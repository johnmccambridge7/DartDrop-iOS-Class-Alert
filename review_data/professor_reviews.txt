Huge workload and extremely hard. I think you really need to have a background in CS or some natural god given ability to thrive in this class Do not take this course with other hard classes. Cormen has tough grading rubric as well. Overall, super rewarding and interesting course, but do not expect an easy time.

He's a good professor but it's a 190 student class, and there's virtually no interaction between the prof and the students except for the questions. The class period tends to get very boring very fast. It's a nice if you're trying to experience new fields in your freshman year, but I would not recommend taking it for a distributive. The workload is heavy. I agree that you should have a natural talent or CS background to achieve high grades in this course.

Hard AF! Prof Cormen is good but very demanding class especially if you have not taken any CS before. Do not take with 2 other tough classes - many withdrew.

Came into CS1 with absolutely no prior experience. If you are interested in CS and find logical/problem-solving puzzles as satisfying as I do, you will be able to do well if you just put in a few hours of extra studying a week (usually just 1-2 for me). Sometimes I felt pretty behind compared to other students with lots of prior experience (especially after the first midterm), but I can definitely say that if you read the lectures Cormen posts on the website, go to section more often then not, and are reasonably intellectually competent, you can easily pull out a B+/A- in this class.

Half of the class had prior coding experience. During first midterm half of the room completed it within an hour, while another half was there for 3 hours. I'm afraid in order to get something close to B- you have to learn Python on your own PRIOR to enrolling into this course. I expected it to be intro course, but ended up dropping it after week 3. First 2 weeks were intro and very deceiving. Grading system is strange. Your lab assignments and homework can change your grade only to plus or minus while grade by itself is based on the 3 exams. To get A you need 98% on exams and above 90% on labs I believe. Prof Cormen is funny guy, but tough. Unless you want to major in CS or have Python knowledge AVOID.
@
Thomas Cormen

Definitely not a class for the faint of heart. You will get stuck debugging for hours. You will find your eyelids drooping as Cormen regales you with the amazing story of how RSA encryption was thought of by a drunk guy. And the tests will make you think that you're taking literature instead of CS (SO MUCH READING). But in the end, its probably worth it, if you're actually interested in CS. Definitely rougher if you've had no CS experience at all as you go from printing out your name in week 1 to encrypting/decrypting files in week 9. Also a bit of a weeder course (at least 20% of the original class dropped out). In the end though, it is really what you make of it. Cormen gives many interesting/frustrating (depending on your viewpoint) extra credit opportunities on the labs that allow you to explore a little beyond class material. If you're just trying to get by though, you could probably learn all the material by just reading the online notes and textbook (project python) as his lectures are essentially 90% that, along with some random, completely irrelevant stories that he just likes to throw in. Do go early to lab section hours if you get stuck debugging as this will save you SO MUCH time and the line usually starts early. And finally, don't forget the three things a constructor does.... Also, laughing at all these salty dropouts who wrote shit reviews abt dis course XD

Probably the worst class I have ever taken and it's all because of the prof 1) He has a bullshit grading rubric, which basically makes all the homework count for basically nothing 2) His exams are unnecessarily wordy, which makes them unnecessarily difficult  The material is really interesting, just take it with ANY other prof and you will have a great time.

I took this course with Prof. Cormen my freshman fall (and was a section leader with Cormen and Farid other times) and I can't recommend it more highly.  It is an amazing class for anyone even marginally interested in CS or math or just learning how to think differently.  The workload is manageable if you start early and go in for help (the section leaders are always available to help you!)

Course Great course, definitely take it even if you dont have interest in majoring in anything that requires cosc. develops an appreciation for something that is all around us  Professor Cormen is incredibly smart and has a lot of experience. He is also very helpful and his course is very well structured.   Workload There's a good amount of work in CS 1 but nothing too bad, definitely manageable if you're not taking two killer courses with it.
@
Thomas Cormen
/course/680
Course Very interesting, but very fast paced. It's hard to keep up a lot of the time, and the material doesn't stop for you. If you don't have a background in CS, get ready for a ride.   Professor Cormen is the smartest dick you will ever meet here. He's incredibly arrogant, but still deserves to be so. Don't ever argue for points though, you won't get anything out of him. In fact, he prides himself in taking more points than he gives if you request a regrade. Stay on his good side though and you'll find yourself with a lot of research opportunities.   Workload SO MUCH FUCKING WORK. I've taken some tough classes here and this beats them all in terms of workload. The labs take 10-12 hours to do, and there are frequent short assignments. Plus, the exams are actually pretty hard.

I had never done any computer science before so i was apprehensive but i really likes this class. We learned how to do a lot of cool stuff and some interesting ideas about computer science, and, considering that i had started with no knowledge in the subject whatsoever, made the class very satisfying. Some of the homework is kind of busy work but most tests your skills very well. there is a quiz before almost every test and i did really badly on them all, but they showed me what i needed to work on so i could perform well on the tests. you definitely don't need the back and you don't even need to go to class, all the notes are perfectly documented online. it helps to go to the lectures though, cormen explains things really well. take this class!

This class is tough. There really is no time to slack off or fall behind. This course is a lot of work, and takes up a lot of time, especially if you're not really a comp sci person.  That being said, Prof Cormen is a good lecturer, and really wants to help each individual student. I would recommend this course, but with caution. Don't take it with other hard classes.

This was my first introduction to Computer Science and Cormen did a great job crafting this class for people without any prior exposure to computer science. Great prof. I'd definitely recommend.
@

/course/680
I took this class because it looked interesting and I wanted the distrib.  The class was really great--it was interesting, Cormen is amazing, and it was definitely geared towards people with little to no programming experience.  The only annoying thing was that there were people in the class who had tons of programming exp and just didn't know java, which made the curve a little bit annoying.  But it was definitely a great experience.  One thing to note is that it was very time intensive for the labs, I found myself spending about 3 hours every Sunday/Monday/Tuesday getting help from the staff.
@
Thomas Cormen
/course/680
General  An excellent introduction to Computer Science. The class was somewhat intense, but very, very interesting. Go to class, pay attention in lectures, and stay on top of the work. Great prof.  Lecture notes for this class are EXCELLENT. Cormen has all of his lectures posted online in note form; these are almost word for word recounts of lecture, including jokes.   Take this class if you are even remotely interested in Computer Science, I can say I enjoyed every bit of it (you may find that it gets addicting after awhile).
@
Thomas Cormen
/course/680
Cormen is inconsiderate about how much work he gives. In the span of two weeks this term we had a lab, a quiz, and a midterm, which are all totally consuming. Also, there is NO TIME to get behind. If you take this course, learn EVERYTHING from the beginning. Otherwise you'll be in a lot of trouble and totally miserable.  Otherwise, he's a pretty good lecturer although there is no real effective way to take notes. You need to be able to write out code/drawings with pencil but he goes to fast to handwrite everything. Luckily he posts the notes online, so even if you miss things, you can look back. And you will miss things.  Overall, one of the hardest classes I've taken. If you're not a computer person now, you will be. Or you'll have to drop the class.
@
Thomas Cormen
/course/680
This course is pretty good and manageable, just don't fall behind.  It's pretty reasonable as long as it's your 1st/2nd priority as a course.  If you're taking other math/science + other demanding courses it's probably not a good combo.  If you're looking to learn a bit about programming, it's useful.  Cormen's a good prof, especially in office hours which really can help.  The undergrad TA's are also good, they helped immensely with the short assignments and labs.  Also, try to take advantage of the grad TA office hours, they can come in handy.  The book is useful if you have the time to read it, otherwise Cormen's notes will suffice.  It is a beast of a challenge though, only take it if you have the time.
@
Thomas Cormen

Lots and lots of work.....lab assignments will kill you if you don't start them early enough....but it's a good class and you learn a TON about programming...  I hadn't taken any CS classes before and knew NOTHING about programming and now I feel a lot more comfortable and the assignments that looked challenging at first now seem really easy.
@
Thomas Cormen
/course/680
This class was amazing! I really enjoyed the material that was covered in this class. The only bad part of the course was when Professor Cormen had two guest lecturers who were grad students that he was testing out speak.  They weren't very good.  Other than that, everything about this course was remarkable. Many people found this course to be challenging, but if you enjoy the material and subject matter like I did, you will have no trouble with it. This was actually one of my easiest classes this term.
@
Thomas Cormen
/course/680
So I came into this class with a bad attitude because I wasn't supposed to take it -- I'm an ENGS major and had been planning on taking ENGS 20 as my computer prereq, but it didn't fit in my schedule, so I had to take CS 5 instead. From the beginning, I kept thinking "Oh, this class will be so useless... I'm not learning anything engineering-related." However, this bad attitude started to fade away as the term went on. I started to actually enjoy programming by the end of it, especially since the lab assignments [although quite hard and reallyyyy time-consuming] were kind of fun. It was awesome to learn how to make the computer do what you want. Professor Cormen is an excellent professor, making what is inherently not the most exciting topic quite entertaining at times. He's an extremely fair prof and is ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS available for help. Definitely take advantage of that! it's not too often that profs reply to blitzes at 11pm on Saturdays! And the homework assignments REALLY helped me understand the material, except my one complaint is that they were far too time-consuming. I spent so much of my life on CS this term -- way more than I would have liked. So be prepared to learn a lot, and perhaps to even learn to like programming, but to also put tons of work into this class. I'd say it's worth it.

Cormen was a great professor, and the class was extremely well done. I do think that the class somewhat favored people who had the time to do extra credit though (I was really busy this term, so it screwed me over on extra credit). There are kids in this class where this is all that they do, so it can be competitive, but the material is not hard at all.
@
Thomas Cormen
/course/680
This was by far my favorite class this term! Professor Cormen is an amazing professor and he makes the course content so interesting! He is very sensitive to student concerns and makes an effort to get to know everyone in the class.  You learn Java in this class and there is a lot of focus on good form and coding practice. I think this course really changes the way you think and if you can, definitely take this class!  You will have 3 quizzes and 3 exams during the year, so the course is broken up (there isn't too much pressure for each quiz/exam). There are around 16 short assignments and 5 labs. The course is definitely fast-paced and pretty demanding, but if you try, you will definitely enjoy it!

don't buy the book or do readings - just go to all the lectures. Practical, interesting, but a LOT of work - be prepared to live in Sudikoff. Attend recitation - it helps with the labs. Great teacher lectures well & is very responsive & helpful (even if you blitz him at 1 AM on the weekend about the assignments or labs. Too bad he'll be on sabbatical for the next 2 years. Online notes and instructions are very thorough and easy to understand. You don't need previous programming exp or knowledge of comp sci, although it might help

Computer Science 5 was by far the best class that I took this term. Cormen was a great lecturer and conveyed the material very well. The material itself was useful, covering the basics of computer science from the ground up. The labs were hard, but fun to do and very rewarding. Highly recommend this class for anyone interested in computer science or analytical thinking.
@
Thomas Cormen
/course/680
This class is pretty interesting, and actually a bit of fun if you have any interest in programming. Most of the enjoyment comes out of doing the labs, where I found myself doing the extra credit just because it was a bit of a challenge. However, lectures are very slow, and definitely oriented towards freshmen, who make up the majority of the class. Not bad for an intro course where people come from very diverse skill backgrounds, but I think Cormen babies people too much by having them turn in short assignments almost every class and having an asinine lateness policy.
@
Thomas Cormen
/course/680
Professor Cormen knows his stuff.  In this course you learn the basics of using Java to create small programs that do things like sort lists and draw basic graphics.  While this course might lead into some useful, fun stuff, as of yet I haven't seen much return for all the hard work I put in except a few dinky little graphical outputs.  That said, when you look back on how difficult it was to do anything, you realize you learned a lot in this course.    As a warning, watch out for falling behind/handing things in late; they do NOT cut you any slack.  That said, Cormen and the TA's are very available for help.  I once got an email back from Professor Cormen at 12 midnight.  Play by the rules, keep up with the course, and you will do well.
@

Coming into this course with absolutely no background in Computer Science and an aversion to programming in general, I was shocked how much I enjoyed this course.  It's a lot of work, and my Wendesday nights were shot since we had quizzes or exams the majority of Thursday, but you get a lab distrib without having to actually go to lab, and the work is fun as well as rewarding.  Cormen is also an AMAZING prof, making the material accessible to everyone, since there is a supremely varied amount of experience amongst the students coming into the course.  Constant tests & assignments mean that if you fall behind you're in big trouble, but as long as you stay on top of your work and are willing to work hard it's very possible to do well.

Cormen is a great teacher.  He provides all of his notes online - the notes, and his lectures, are very clear, straightforward, and effective at explaining material which can often be quite complex.  Cormen also manages to keep the lectures entertaining with demonstrations and corny jokes.  My only complaint with Cormen is that he can be somewhat sarcastic when aswering students' questions in class, which doesn't exactly motivate kids to ask for help.  I found writing code (Java) to be a very enjoyable experience.  I enjoyed that it felt like solving a logic puzzle, and when I finally got a program to work I felt like a Godly Creator.
@

You will be worked in this class and worked hard. Do not take this course as a distrib killer; you should only take it if you have some interest in computer science.   Make sure you use all of the resources. Prof. Cormen is an amazing resource who makes himself really available.   DO NOT GET BEHIND IN THIS COURSE! That is the key to your success.

Definitely a good deal of work, but the material's interesting, Cormen's a good professor, and coding can be addicting.  If you're unsure about the courseload, throw an NRO on it.  Of course, that doesn't mean you can get away not doing work - especially given that the only way to learn programming is to get dirty coding Java.

the course was being taught for the first time so most of the assignments were really obscure and it was often difficult to figure out what he wanted us to do. I learned the most during the TA help sessions.
@
Thomas Cormen
/course/680
Prof. Cormen loves teaching CS 5, and he's good at it. The only problem is that you need to know how to take the class. First, do NOT buy the textbook. It's a waste of money and you really do not need it. He has every lecture written out for you on the internet, WORD FOR WORD, including the jokes he makes. Print all the lectures out because it's all you will need. Do the extra credit, because my 88.88% final grade got me a B and he would have bumped it if I did extra credit. Watch out if you are not a computer science person, because lots of freshman come into the classing knowing a lot and do very well to raise the medians. Use your TA's, they help you tremendously. Good class, boring lectures, a little fast paced, a lot of work, but you learn how to get it done.

This was by far one of the best classes I've had at Dartmouth.  Cormen was amazing.  I def recommend taking the class with him but i head he was taking his sabbatical next year so he won't teach this class for the next year.  The class is a lot of work but it is very fun.  You shouldn't put things off until the last minute because that will screw you over.  Go to the lab if you need help because the TAs were very helpful.   His quizzes were a little tricky on purpose but if you know the info, you will make a good grade in the class.  Also, there is extra credit in the class so you can either get bumped up if you are on the edge or get a citation.

Cormen's a really talented prof - it's obvious he has loads of experience in the field, but he hasn't lost his touch at teaching - he's personable and has no problem engaging with students inside or outside class. I didn't want to be one of those that puts a 5 in every box but I couldn't resist. Take a class with him if you can.  I had fun just with the course material as well, and I learned a lot. Theres always some useful yet cool element to the regular short assignments that makes them more enjoyable than any other kind of homework, and they're the best way to drive the material into your brain. The only drawback was restriction to the Java language - maybe take ENGS 20 if you want something more physically "practical" than random but awesome (cause you made it yourself) web applets.

As a non-major, I took this course during my Senior spring purely out of an interest in learning some java programming.

Don't be scared off from taking this class by the work load, because this is one of the best classes at Dartmouth.  Prof. Cormen is excellent and extremely nice.  If you do all the homework in the class, it is pretty easy to get an A or A-.  My favorite aspect of the course is that everyone in it forms a small community.  We all work on labs together and everything, so you make a lot of new friends and you really enjoy programming.  Cormen helps make this class very interesting, you won't regret taking it.  It's so cool to be able to make your own programs, and you'll be amazed by how much you learn in such a short time!  Take this class (but make sure its with Cormen)!

Professor Cormen is a miracle worker.  The amount of material covered in CS 5 is immense compared to introductory programming courses at other colleges.  Cormen however managed to make it all seem accessible to the majority of students.  But, don't get me wrong, the course still requires a lot of work, and if you fall behind, you will do badly.  However even though the breadth of the material is great and the work accompanying it as well, if you go to class, do the assignments, and don't fall behind you'll be left with a good grade and a great experience learning from Professor Cormen.

This was by far the best class I've taken so far at Dartmouth. I hadn't had any past experience with computer programming whatsoever before coming into CS5, and was intially really nervous about taking the course because i had hard that it was really hard, incredibly time consuming, and that everyone who takes it plans to major and has had past computer experience. This is completely not true!!! Cormen is an amazing lecturer, and the amount of time he puts into his class and the class notes, assignments, etc, is incredible. the course is designed for people with absolutely no past computer-programming experience, and within 2 weeks everyone in the class is on even footing regardless of any past experience they might have. cormen is one of the best, most knowledgable, and caring professors at dartmouth. despite being chair of the writing program, and heavily involved with the computer science department and world-renowned for many of his works, he refuses to give up teaching an intro level computer science course. he teaches CS5 because he loves it, and it shows. he's always available in office hours, and will form a personal relationship with nearly every person in the class by the end of the term, connecting names to faces within the first week. this being said - the course can be time consuming. it is not, however, incredibly difficult in a conceptual sense, but rather just time-consuming to get the labs done on time and keep up with the work. but although the labs do take up some time, they are so well-designed that if you do them and keep up with the homework, you will know the material for the tests like the back of your hand. overall, the amount you learn in 9 short weeks in CS5 is incredible and will change the way you think about everyday problems. its knowledge that you will use for the rest of your life, very applicable, and incredibly interesting. i especially recommend this course for those without any prior computer experience. absolutely amazing course. i could go on, but just take it. also, you get your lab requirement as cormen repeatedly petitioned the college this term to get CS5 recognized as a LAB course, and told us on the last day of classes.

java doesnt have the rep that c++ has.   but seri, good prof, good course. the only real problem with it is the notes are online, so if you dont like lectures, theres really no incentive to haul yourself all the way over to moore. but the times i went to class i was glad i did. the prof's explanations are always good. he's a bit corny/into himself. but not in a way that's overly annoying. and he works really hard to get to know all the students, which is needless to say impressive in a course of that size.

Awesome class. Cormen is a great teacher and is generally interesting even though he is in front of almost 100 people. If he moves too slowly, you can simply miss class and just read his online notes which are almost word-for-word. Great availability for assistance by Cormen and the TAs.
@
Thomas Cormen
/course/680
Even though there was a lot of work, the class was definitely worth it! I felt like it took me longer to get the concepts so I always took a long time to do the assignments. The TAs were so helpful! I was in the Sudikoff computer room almost every night when we had lab assignments due but that's just me. The assignments did reinforce what we learned in class and they were always fun to do despite requiring a lot of time in my case.
@

First of all, I agree with most of the other reviews; Cormen is a great prof. He is funny, smart, and gives great lectures. His lecture notes are online, too, and they are a very helpful resource.  I had no cs experience and don't consider myself very technically-adept; I'm a humanities major. So, this course was very time-consuming for me. I was taking two other challenging courses at the time, and I really just did not have the time and energy to put the necessary effort into some of the assignments. The TAs are a helpful resource, and they certainly alleviated a lot of my frusturation. Be willing to ask for help and spend a few hours every night reviewing material and doing lab and homework assignments, and you should be okay. Ultimately, I am glad that I took this class as an introduction to computer science.

For me the course is broken into three parts. The first part is painstakingly boring if you've had any programming experience before. Cormen aims for the people who are completely new to the subject, which slows the class down at first. He puts all of his notes on the web so you can skip if you want. A warning though, grades at the end are always somewhat subjective, and if you go to class, go to office hours, and appear to make an effort, he's nicer in terms of grading.  The second third starts to get into more interesting, complete projects, including some partner labs. This was the best part of the class.  The last third is tedious dealing with program efficiency. It isn't that hard of a concept, is boring, and ends the term on a blah note.  Quizzes were conceptually based, exams programming based. Usually people could do well on at least one or the other, so they helped their grades. A fair method of testing the material.  Cormen was an awesome professor if corny at times. His animated lectures really helped you remember the material. Sometimes they were tedious, but that was because he tried to make sure everyone understood everything. He is always available to help. He even answered blitzes at 1 am on the nights before assignments were due. Office hours are a great way to get help and get to know him.

This class is very challenging for people who have never done programming before, but there is so much help available (from the prof, to the TA's in lab, to the prof's TA's) that anyone can learn it.  It does take some work, but it isn't hard to get a good grade if you seek out help.  Professor Cormen is amazing too.  I would HIGHLY recommend taking the course from him if you are able.
@

I took this course on the advice of a friend who thought I might like the subject. I never imagined that I would want to be a computer science major, but now I am heading down that path. This was the most interesting and exciting class I've taken at Dartmouth to date. Prof. Cormen is competent and enthusiastic. The assignments were challenging but doable, and there was always plenty of help when I got stuck. If you think you have any interest in the subject (or even just like problem solving), I recommend taking this course. By the way, the workload is not bad (I know when I read others' reviews before taking the class, they said it was and that almost discouraged me from taking the class.)
@

don't listen to the horror stories.  it's not too bad.  All the lecture notes are posted online, so I basically only went to class cause I enjoyed Cormen's lectures.

Don't get behind in the work in this course. It's just too much material to be able to catch back up.  It's a lot of work, but if you're even remotely interested in computers, take this course. You'll learn a lot. Perhaps TOO MUCH! But you should take it anyway.

Get used to the term Short Assignment and Labs.  Our class had about 13 short assignmnets and 6 labs.  That means at least one short assignment a week and the last 6 weeks 1 lab a week.  A lot of work, but if you put in the time it is manageable.

Having never programmed before I found the work for this class more time-consuming than that of most other classes. That being said, I did learn far more than I expected to. Cormen is a great lecturer, very enthusiastic, tells terrible but funny jokes, and does a good job making the material accessible. If you're willing to put in the time necessary to complete all the assignments this class is definitely rewarding. Overall, it's not nearly as bad as its reputation, and with the right attitude it can be a lot of fun.

Lots of work, but you learn a lot in the class. Cormen is an interesting & engaging lecturer - he also has the surprising ability to memorize names + random facts about you (even though you rarely show up for class). The class was a huge time commitment - (all the x hours are used + an additional 1hr recitation session/wk), but it's pretty hard not to get a good grade.

I'm the most unlikely person ever to take CS5 - a combination of all the wrong attributes disorderly, unmathematical, not even remotely considering a CS major (hello - I'm going to be a hardcore English major), a freshman, juggling several extracurriculars... but I took CS5 out of pure interest, and enjoyed it, sort of masochistically, and ended up doing vaguely all right in the end.  Oh yes - and now that I understand how for-loops work, and a little bit about how to manipulate data structures, it's been a lot easier for me to teach myself other useful things like PHP.  There, that's about all.

Its not as hard as some people make it out to be.  Concepts and logic are easy once you get the hang of things and start to think in the way you need to.  I did it freshman fall with no prior experience and I survived intact and happy.  Cormen's pretty damn good.

The assignments in this class are very interesting and really teach you a lot about programming. The lectures themselves, however, can be very boring, and I often learned more by staying home and just reading the lecture notes instead (at least then I don't fall asleep). Everyone should have a basic knowledge of this stuff nowadays, so I recommend the class. Careful though, if you aren't science-minded going into this class, a lot of the assignments can be really tough. Plan to spend a lot of time on them.

If you have past experience this course is still a bunch of work, but is not that difficult. If you're learning everything for the first time, be prepared to study.  Prof. Cormen gives well organized lectures and really wants you to learn the material. His jokes are great.

Definitely not an easy way to satisfy your TAS req, but a must for anyone with a serious interest in computers.  Even for non-majors, the JAVA skills you'll develop are incredible, and immensely useful.  Take it if you have a lot of time to spare.

I will recommend this course to anyone who would like to learn what Computer Science is all about. Apart from learning JAVA programming language, you learn how to think as a programmer. Materials are not so hard to understand and homeworks are really fun. Although be prepared. The amount of the homework and short assignement you will get is overwhelming. If you are prepared, an excellent course!

The course left me with one regret  that as a senior it is too late for me to even pursue a minor in CS.  I will definitely be continuing in the CS department until graduation, however, because this stuff is absolutely fantastic.  This is definitely a class you either love or hate.  If you hate the first short assignment, get out!  Programming is not for you.  If you find yourself eagerly awaiting the first homework, congratulations!  But a word of warning  letting yourself get caught up in doing extra credit is a potential hazard, especially if you really find this class fun.  It will steal your life away, and you will pour hours upon hours into your assignments AFTER the basic requirements are already done!

Tough class. Professor Cormen is a great prof but the amount of work is a bit absurd. Plus the exams and long assignments are extremely long. The last half of the term was absolutely chaotic. Lots of work. But in the end, you learn a lot from Cormen and I think it's a worthwhile class if you're dedicated to putting a lot of work into it.

This class is difficult, mostly because of the amount of time required, but it is challenging in a good way, especially if you enjoy logic problems and are decent at math. It can be frustrating at times, but the programs you write for homework are actually pretty cool, and it's worth taking this course even if you're not a major as so many things involve computers today. I probably won't ever take another computer science course, or even write another program, but I'm glad I took this course. But, be prepared for work if you want to do well.

Professor Cormen is smart, and he'll let you know it.  He seems to enjoy his work, but he also enjoys being smart.  He'll let you know if you're not doing things his way, and he expects you to do things the same way he does, which isn't the most effective way to teach a problem solving course like CS 5.  One of the beauties of this course is that there are many ways to work something out, but Cormen prefers his students to do things his way.    That's my only complaint.  It's a lot of work, but I enjoyed it.  Cormen does a good job of presenting the material, and the TA's are helpful, if you want them to be.
@

This class was a great class, if you had the time to do all the work.  The homeworks were very time-consuming, but also very helpful.  Cormen gives good lectures (although his sense of humor can get kind of annoying).  Warning... the exams are long.  The first midterm took about 4-5 hours, the second 3-4, and the final took up almost all 3 hours.  It's a really great class, but I would only recommend it if you have the tenacity to work on code for many hours and you have the hours to spend on it.
@
Thomas Cormen
/course/680
My only criticism of this class is the exam format. The professor has a significant portion of the exams based on writing code on paper, which I quickly learned is vastly different from coding on a computer, where you can test your code and relatively quickly determine where there are errors in the code. A plus side to exams is the professor allows you to make a 8.5"x11" double sided crib sheet upon which you can write anything you want... this helped a lot on the short answer questions, but I found when coding, I remembered all I needed to and the crib sheet helped minimally. It's the small mistakes you don't realize you make in the code that takes off points from your exam grade. I found course material was extremely interesting, and I enjoyed coding. Having prior experience in coding helps immensely, though make sure you are flexible, because a significant portion of grading is also based on code "style". Make sure you give yourself plenty of time to do homework... procrastination in this course definitely affects your grade.

If you just want to take this for fun, do so in the spring term. Cormen is an excellent professor, but can be very confusing to people with absolutely no background. Also be prepared to throw a lot of time into this course.

I signed up for CS 5 looking to fulfill my TAS, but by the end of the term I was looking at ways to change my major to Computer Science or modify my major to include Computer Science.  Cormen is a wonderful professor who responds to students during class and is available outside of class as well.  The HWs are challenging, but you have a week to do them, which means if you get started early you should have no problem.  Short Assignments are also given to reinforce what has just been taught.  The TAs in this course are so helpful because they do everything from help you with HW to reviewing concepts we have learned during the weekly review sessions.  Lab hours are particularly helpful, if only to get you going on the right track.  The topics we covered in this course were very interesting, and the assignments were generally fun such as creating applets that display raindrops and programs that kill soldiers and cats (you'll just have to take the course!).  I have heard that people enjoy this class a lot more than its ENGNS equivalent.

This class takes a ton of time--but if you're willing to put that time in, it's completely worth it.  It gives you a very solid background in Java and in computer science in general, and I thought it was fun along the way.  The professor is great; he will go out of his way to help you with the material, and is very responsive to student input during lecture.  I really enjoyed this class.

This class is difficult and time consuming if you don't have a programing background, which I didn't.  However, it is very worth it.  THe material is interesting, and Cormen is amusing and gives very good lectures.  The test are not too difficult, but it is hard to get used to the format (untimed).  About ten people dropped the class after the first test.  This class has convinced me to continue in computer science.

CS 5 is supposed to be a really difficult course, but in fact, if you've had any kind of programming experience before (and I really mean anything), it should be easy for you. And if you haven't, as long as you think logically, you shouldn't have too much trouble. Besides, Prof Cormen is a great teacher for someone having trouble undestanding the material. His lectures basically summarize the contents of the book, which, although somewhat frustrating for people who've read the book, is great for those who haven't understood it. Yes, the homework takes quite a bit of time especially the extra credit options), but most of the time it's kind of fun, so it's a lot better than, say, math problems... Anyway, I strongly recommend this course. It's not as hard as it sounds!
@
Thomas Cormen
/course/680
CS 5 is a great class but it is a lot of work.  If you are a logical person, the work is more time than difficulty; if you are not, the work is both but even so is worth the effort.  Cormen is a great lecturer so you'll want to go to class, but even if you miss the stuff is on the web.  He isn't such a great guy in person so I'd say don't bother going to office hours unless you don't fit the standard cs profile, in which case he really will go to a lot of effort to encourage you to major.  Even so, that doesn't detract from his ability to teach the subject to a large group.  Take this class, but do have the time to put into it.

CS5 is a great course.  i learned an extraordinary amount, i couldn't even learn it all as well as i wanted to!  i was disencouraged however, by the amount of computer programming that other students had in the course.  i was treading water from day one just to keep up.  and no matter what, i was not able to do well on exams due to this disadvantage.  it's frustrating to me, to have to take a class and know that i can never get above a certain grade due to my lack of experience.  i feel like the same course should be offerred for students with zero experience.  it's supposed to be an introduction to computer science, that is the title of the course!!  If another course was offerred, however, students should not be penalized for taking it, nor should the pace be much slower.

The class serves as a fabulous intro to programming. Computer Science is used in almost every field in tomorrow's world; so a solid introduction to computer science is in some sense a prereq for any college major. This class is able to introduce a computer novice to the world of programming in an effective manner because it has a reasonable pace, very fair homeworks and tests, and, best of all, a dedicated prof that always makes himself available outside of class.  I would definitely recommend this class to students of any major, as mentioned before--computers are prereqs for anything one wishes to do in the future.

('21) - I took a small introductory course on java and HTML in junior year of highschool before taking this class and found that the skills I had learned helped for only the first two classes. The pace is extremely, but understandably, fast. Learning 95% of Python and being able to say you're "proficient" on your resume comes at the price of learning the material VERY quickly. However, I think that for the most part, the class was taught pretty efficiently and completely. Balkcom's lectures chronologically mirrored the online textbook (that he wrote) and that was helpful in terms of consistency and what to expect on exams. The textbook itself was on the whole pretty satisfactory; it's written colloquially and contains relevant, interactive exercises that helped improve my understanding of the material. We first learned the basics of code and then following units were built off of the previous ones, ensuring that you understood the material before you moved on. That said, it's imperative that you understand the material before attempting to move on and that you do so at a pace that mirrors the class. It's very easy to get lost and behind in assignments and understanding concepts. The "short" assignments and labs were sometimes annoying just because they take so long to do if you're determined to figure it out on your own, and they're assigned so frequently. What really helped me were the recitation sections. Sections are led by different leaders, so I can't say this for everyone, but my section leader was particularly thorough in his responsibilities. He created problem sets, mandated attendance, helped us out with assignments, answered questions and graded promptly, and was overall very understanding of our struggle to understand new material. On the whole, this class improved my Dartmouth academic experience. It encourages you to think critically and to break down problems into bite-sized pieces and work from the ground up - a super useful skillset to have in all disciplines. This course made me rethink my major/minor studies.

Okay class for people to get a grip on basic coding concepts.  Terrible and perhaps the worst Intro CS class at any Ivy school for people who actually want to major in CS. It uses a bootleg library made off Python Canvas/QWidgets to teach some concepts of variables through animation etc? It will give terrible habits to people who will actually continue to code. Grading is ridiculous, they require you to comment code that you write on paper, or name your variables with a word etc.  Hoping they switch to C++ or start off with Python from a much lower and deeper level. I mean it takes them just 11 lectures to reach Classes and OOP.... Half of the people in class don't even know how a float is stored in memory. Or how do temporary variables used in functions get stored... Anything bitwise isn't even covered by the class.

I was one of those people that had to drop the class-- I had no background in CS before taking it and most of the people who take it have a general understanding of CS before coming. I found it super interesting, definitely worthwhile in that sense. The workload was manageable at first, but once they started doing labs that combined physics and coding I was lost and I was truly lost on assignments. I found that I could get by on  assignments, but they took me ten times longer than any one else and I would simply run the code a billion times to see if it worked but didn't really understand my errors. This proved to be a horrible for the midterm since it was handwritten and you really need a deep understanding to get a good grade. I was in way over my head! Make sure you know what you are getting into and ask around before committing to this class!

Good ol' CS 1 at Dartmouth. An incredibly valuable class and I have no regrets about taking it. However, I think every term—(at least this term when I took it)—at least 5-10 people will drop the course. I think that just shows you how hard it is. That said, I'd DEFINITELY take it. So so so worth it, but just know what you're getting into.

Although I had some limited CS experience prior, this class was my first serious attempt at CS. I loved it. Professor Balkcom is an amazing professor and engaging lecturer. He is always willing to answer questions, no matter how small, and is willing to meet with you almost anytime outside of class.  As long as you take the labs and homework seriously, ask questions, and don't start the night before, you'll do fine. The class isn't too difficult.  I wholeheartedly recommend this course.

I had absolutely no programming experience before taking this class so everything that we did was new for me. I have to say that I felt like a lot of students had an advantage in the class since many people had done some programming in high school, but I still felt like I was able to keep up in the class.  If you're like me and have no prior computer programming experience, this class will definitely open your eyes to new ways to thinking about problems. I found the labs and short assignments to be a lot of fun, though very time consuming (labs took me about 15 hours to complete).  Don't fall behind in labs and short assignments and you'll be fine!

This course is really well-designed and interesting, and Professor Balkcom was outstanding (a very endearing and humble guy). It does move fast, but you will leave the class able to learn any other object-oriented programming language in less than a week. I learned Python in 3 days, knowing 0 programming before I started CS 5. Labs aren't bad at all.

I don't even want to know how many hours I spent on these assignments, but I know good and well that they completely ruined my fall term. I think I pulled three all-nighters getting them done, and I didn't even put them off until the last minute. I've never been happier when a class ended than I was after turning in my final for this class.  That being said, I did learn a lot about programming, and (god I hate to say this) I'm glad I took this class. I actually got a lot out of it.  If you take this class, don't be intimidated by the kids who already know everything about programming, pay attention in the lectures, read the book, and go to the lab hours. Do that and you'll be fine.
@

/course/680
The course was fair overall.  The homework assignments were short and easy.  The labs were easy at the start and became more challenging.  Fortunately, Professor Balkcom posted most of the pseudocode for the labs online so that it became a matter of translation.  The exams felt easy and challenging at the same time, but they mostly covered material explained in class.  Each exam had a tricky question, but the grading was generous.  Professor Balkcom allows students to write second answers in the margins in case if the first answer is wrong.  You will still be deducted if your original answer is incorrect, but not by much if the second is correct.  The students are also permitted a single-sided cheat sheet for crucial information. The class lectures were essential for doing well in the course.  Attend them!  At times, they were interesting and thought provoking and at others, they just went over my head.  Professor Balkcom is responsive in office hours and holds optional (but necessary) review sessions before the exams. Overall, the course is relatively easy if you took computer science in high school.  However, the first half of the course was a little slow with the syntax and the second half was at a slightly rapid pace with sorting and run times.  Take this course if you are interested in computer science or just want to fill your distributive requirement, but be prepared to work.

if you're interested in CS and have some prior coding experience, you'll probably love this class. It requires a lot of self-initiative to succeed (reading over lecture notes, going to office hours, lab, etc.), but if you take advantage of the support system they provide you with, you'll do great. The class was rather time-consuming...
@
Devin Balkcom

This was my first experience with CS of any sort, so the reviews from prior terms that spoke of death and destruction to those without experience almost spooked me off.  But I'm glad they didn't.  Admittedly this class eats your time, and I wouldn't recommend it if you're taking two other time-intensive courses, but at least the time spent was interesting.  Lectures became dull at times, but that was because even an animated lecturer such as Balkcom can't do much with some of the bone-dry material within Java.  Most of the time, however, he did succeed in keeping my attention, and doing it well.  Short assignments are basically a joke if you've been paying attention in class, but the labs are more serious.  Be prepared to spend an entire weekend for each one (possibly going to lab hours for help), and it might even be wise to begin on the Wednesday that each lab is assigned (only one week is given to complete them).  Exams are completely fair and even enjoyable (questions referencing Transformers, R2-D2, and Batman?), and are made quite easy by the allowance of a single sided cheat sheet.  Write small enough, and you can manage to bring the entire course syllabus into the test.  Upon completion of the course, I feel that I have a new and useful skill to enter the job market with, and I certainly plan on taking other CS courses.  Oh, and I didn't open the textbook once.  My advice don't buy it.

The course is a lot of work and extremely fast. The professor did the best he could in lectures, but the only way to learn programming is to actually do it, and that's time commitment.

This class is just your intro to java programming class. I took AP computer science A, and this really helped me out in the first section of the course.  The short assignments are usually pretty easy, and they help you learn the material. The labs are hard.  Extremely hard. Expect to spend many many hours on them- at LEAST 10 hours each. You have a week to do them. Start the day you get them. Go to recitation session every week.  The section leaders give you lots of hints on how to do the labs.  Trust me, you will need help. If you want to take this class "for fun", don't, unless you love programming. Overall, a pretty good class, and Balkcom is a good prof.

i took this course kind of as a third class, but it turned out to be a lot of time and effort.  the coursework centers on the labs, which are take-home programming assignments that can take a lot of time depending on the student.  i spent up to 15 or 20 hours on the hardest ones.  that said, writing programs was a lot more fun than writing papers or doing problem sets.  going to the lab itself in sudikoff was really helpful, the TAs help you with your mistakes and show you how to do some of the tricky parts of the labs.  you have to go to "recitation sessions," which are boring and kind of a waste of time.  a TA answers questions that you have about the assignments for 1 hour once a week... it doesn't seem like a lot but they were really a pain in the ass.  balkcom is pretty good, it's a large class so it's hard to get to know him, but he's fun and nerdy in an endearing way.  and he is good at what he does, and is pretty good at explaining the central concepts of Java and CS.

I took some CS in high school so the beginning two to three weeks through the first midterm were really easy for me.  Then the class got really time consuming and difficult.  The lectures were not really interesting and could be read in their entirety online, so you really have to make sure to go to class.  Overall the midterms are fair to hard, the short assignments are really easy and the labs very time consuming.  Do not take this course with 2 other time consuming courses or your term will be no fun.

I was a transfer student my first term and I had taken one term of introductory computer science at my previous institution which I found easy, so I was not expecting the intense workloads that came with CS5. This is a very tough course for those who have had little or no previous experience with programming, but if your other courses are easy and not very time consuming, I would definitely recommend it.  The course is comprised of 5 lab assignments which you are given (and need) a week to do, and somewhere between ten and fifteen short assignments that you are given two or three days to complete. There are two midterms and a final, all of which are graded very fairly and are at times enjoyable. Professor Balkcom used Transformers and other funny examples in his exam questions which made (parts of) the test sort of enjoyable.  Professor Balkcom is probably the best professor I have ever had. He is a fantastic lecturer and does very well with even some very dry material. He kept me interested in programming all the way through the course, and tried to give us a broader range of knowledge than even the curriculum demanded. He also explained very well even the most complex of concepts to make them understandable to every kid in class. Professor Balkcom even came to the Lab sessions at times when there were not enough TAs, and was always very helpful and available outside of class.  DEFINITELY take this class for your TLA - it's a really useful thing to learn (programming) and Balkcom is the best! Just don't take it with other hard courses, and expect to spend a lot of time in Sudikoff.

People seem to absolutely love or absolutely hate CS 5. I was one of the people who absolutely loved it. Beware the people who blast the course, as they're biased, too.  I had little experience with CS before this course, and took it partially on a whim. I'm so glad I did, and now I'm considering majoring. I thought that the successful CS people already knew who they were before they arrived at college, but that is not true at all. You don't need to be a CS person, or have programmed before, to enjoy this course.   The course is extremely well organized and efficient. Though the lectures are often dry, they gave you the tools to use for the labs, the fun part of the course. I think everyone spends a long time on the labs, either because you find them very difficult or because you enjoy them so much you find yourself doing extra credit.  The real reason to take the course is because it's fun. Labs were problem solving, but not in a math way, more in a Legos way. If you're curious, I'd recommend you go for it.  Professor Balkcom is awesome. If at all possible, take it with him. He's extremely clear, funny, and relates well with his students. The people who hated the course, for the most part, still loved him.  There is the chance that you will hate the course, though. For one, it is a lot of time, and you have to be willing to commit to it. If you procrastinate on labs, they will destroy you. Also, it seems that some peoples' minds just didn't work well with Java. For them, the long hours on the labs were not enjoyable, but painful. There is help available for the labs if you seek it out, and the grading is actually pretty light (you get practically 100% on all of the programming assignments, so it's difficult to do too poorly, though the tests are tough), so worst case scenario is not too bad.  Don't take the course if you think it's an intro and therefore it'll be easy. Don't take the course if you think that you should learn something about computers in college and want to gain some familiarity- the skills in this course aren't everyday-practical.   Do take this course if you're interested in technology and want to learn to harness the power of computers.

Coming into this class I had heard horror stories about how C.S. 5 was difficult and a ton of work, and I had braced myself for the worse. Thus I completely shocked when I actually took this course to find out how mind-numbingly easy it was.   Excluding the EC, none of the labs took more than 7-8 hours, and most took only about 4. The Short Assignments are a joke, and only took about 15-20 minutes each. And the Exams were easy for anyone who can program on the fly, as you are given a double-sided cheat sheet, and unlimited time to complete them. Overall this course is so easy, and there are so many ways to boost your grade (thus the reason the median was an A), that I can't imagine how anyone could possibly think this was a hard course. So in conclusion, if you want an incredibly easy way to get a TLA, take this course.    Full Disclosure I am not a CS or Math Major, and had never programmed before taking this course.  I did however do all my work on time, which was all that was required to get an A in this course.

Unless you have programmed before, do NOT take this class.  It will ruin your entire term.  There is an unreasonable amount of work, and you will have no time for any of your other classes.  This is the absolute WORST class I have taken at dartmouth and I would recomend it to no one.  Actually, if you are opposed to fun you might enjoy this course.  If you want to ruin your term but spending an outrageous amount of time per week learning a new language, and you put in the work, you will probably get a good grade though.   Balkcom assumes that you know whats going on, and from the outset you will be completely confused if you have never programmed.  Most importantly, what you learn in this class you will NEVER use.  You have to take many more terrible classes like it to actually get to the point where you can implement what you are learning into real life situations.

This is a fun class, not too difficult.  Good way to get a TLA.  The labs aren't too hard and prof's instructions/section leaders practically tell you how to do them.  Just keep up with assignments and labs.  Don't buy the textbook-- it's optional, and I haven't used it since the second week of class.  All the resources you need are in the lecture notes (typed up in paragraph form and posted online) and the API, available online off of the CS5 page.

Before taking this class I read a lot of reviews saying that you should only take the class if you want to be a CS major or have coded before, and I ignored them. Big mistake. Prior experience won't actually help you-- the coding and labs are actually fairly easy, but 1/2 of the material on the test is stuff that has absolutely zero application to the coding that you will actually do for the class, so unless you're independently fascinated with computer science, and not just coding, stay far away.

Comp sci isn't for everyone, but you should find that out for yourself.  There is a good amount of work for this class, but it's not impossible and there are many people you can go talk to for help (section leader, professor, TA, smart friends).  The stuff you learn is pretty interesting and you get a real sense of accomplishment after writing a computer program.  You just can't get the same feeling from writing a paper about Roman architecture.

I'm still not sure how I feel about this course.  You spend the first 2/3 of the course learning the Java programming language which is pretty interesting and you learn to write some neat programs.  The nice thing about this course is that for the most part, instead of sitting down to study, a lot of the work is hands on and problem solving within your program.  On the downside, this can be very time consuming.  The TA's were very helpful and I encourage everyone to take advantage of the lab hours.  The last 1/3 of the course covers different algorithms and sorting techniques and is very dry and tedious.  If you take this course begin your lab assignments the day they are handed out, you'll be thankful for it.  Balkcom is a pretty cool character, kinda quirky, but is very enthusiastic about what he does, he's a good guy.

Some parts of the tests/labs were a bit more difficult than they had to be.  The course does a good job of introducing you to the basic concepts of CS and programming.  Be prepared to do a lot of programming work, though actually learning the material usually does not take as long.

So I thought that this class would be an easy A because several dormmates of mine were taking the course, and two of the section leaders lived in the same dorm as I.  Unfortunately, with all the extra help I got, it was still a struggle to understand the material and get the assignments done correctly.  As a person with absolutely no prior java experience, I was basically lost by the first week.  It was a struggle to keep up.  Nevertheless, lectures aren't really that essential; most of the learning happens when you're doing the assignments.  It's not even necessary to get the text book; I referenced it maybe twice during the quarter.  What's really important is to go to your recitation section and not start the labs the night before.

This was a good way for me to get rid of the TLA requirement, and I had taken the AP CS A, so the first few weeks were a breeze. Into the fourth or fifth week though, it was all new material for me. But there was nothing that I couldn't figure out just from reading the online notes. The professor had said "Think like a computer" if we ever ran into a debugging problem and needed to figure out the error - but that is easier said than done if you are not a logical thinker.

CS 5 is one of those courses where nothing really makes sense, but somehow it all turns out okay. Prof. Balkcom sometimes (usually) spends most of his lectures explaining things that you won't have to know, except in theory. If you do all the short assignments/labs correctly and promptly (you get second chances to turn in the short assignments and the labs have tons of extra credit) that's how you'll ace the class. go to recitation, and have things explained to you there, study the past tests really well. even if you do poorly on the tests, theres still a lot of chances to do really well in the class.

cs 5 requires a lot of time to learn Java, meaning that homework assignments can take forever 10+ hr but it is mostly full proof for you to learn the material. if you're in the sciences, i strongly recommend the course. Balkcom is young and excited about teaching although he did get his facts messed up enough for it to be annoying.  there are lots of places for extra credit to raise your grade and homeworks count more than exams and teachers and ta are very very willing to provide help (practically do the work for you) if you seek them out.

He's a good lecturer and a nice guy.  About the class expect to do a lot of work; start the assignments (esp. the labs) early. The TA's are v. helpful if you get stuck though. Some of the labs (esp. Life)are really cool and you'll be SO proud of yourself. This class was a *tremendous* learning experience, more so than any other class i've taken at Dartmouth. TAKE IT!

I had absolutely no experience in computer programming, but I did really well and I understand computers a whole lot better now. Professor Balkcom is an awesome prof. I actually did pretty much all of the reading then realized I probably didn't even need to buy the book since EVERYTHING is online. The lab assignments can be challenging but they aren't too bad and both the TAs and prof help if you just blitz them. and in the end you have a bunch of computer programs you can play with and feel like you've actually accomplished something so take this class if you have even a bit of interest in CS or if you just feel embarrassed by the fact that little kiddies these days know how to do so much more than you

Having taken some C++ in high school, I think I was a little ahead of some people in the beginning (so I can't really speak for people with no previous experience).  However, if you know what a for loop is, as long as you go to class you can ace this course.  In the beginning I did the readings (and they helped), but the latter half of the course is mostly from material in class.  The notes are all online (huge resource!), which has saved me several times.    Basically, you have short assignments due every few days at the beginning of the term (not too hard) - just beware the labs!  There are six of them, and most people cannot do them in a single night (plus if you start early, you can get help from the TAs).  Overall a great introductory course not focusing so much on comp sci so much as basic programming skills in Java.

This class wasn't very difficult and didn't take any more time than your tipical class.  Devin was a pretty good prof.  He is very enthusiatic.  Unfortunately computer science is very boring, so it is hard to make the lectures interesting.  The notes online are very helpful (moreso than the book) and all of the test questions are from the online notes.  If you don't want to spend the money, you shouldn't buy the book--you don't need it.  I started off reading the book and then realized that you don't need to.  EVERYTHING you need to know is online.

This course is an exceptionally hard introduction to computer science. We dove straight into Java and never looked back. The order of the curriculum is definitely non-standard, but worked fine.  BEWARE if you haven't had an programming courses before. It will be easy if you have, or very hard if you haven't. It;s doable, but expect it to be your hardest class that term.  Devin was simply awesome. He's young, makes lighthearted anti-GOP jokes, and tries to make the stuff interesting. Get to know him!  The lab's are very hard. However, go to all the (4) classes/ (1)section and read the book. You'll do fine. Devin will give you lots of points back if you just give him your tests to regrade.

When I began this class, I had no bones in my right arm. Taking this class not only drastically improved my nonexistent programming skills but gave me the will to grow bones in my right arm, which has really made life a lot kinder to me. When the list of students in this class was leaked to the school, men and women alike began to flock to me by the second week, not only in Alpha Chi and Sig Delt but while at Foco or walking across the green. It got so bad that I had to shut myself in my room for a while. But I was never bored, for I had my computer in my room. And I had the power to program.

Having taken CS in high school, I imagine I had an easier time of it than most. That said, it was still fairly interesting, and I am glad I took the class instead of trying to test out.  Lectures can be dry, as code examples often don't translate well, but the prof is engaging and truly interested both in the subject and in teaching.  Short assignments every few days were useful to make sure you were on track - they were usually pretty straightforward, but very helpful in terms of figuring out what was considered important.  Exams were written, which I find an irritating format, but questions were fair and generally code-based.

Before taking this course, I didn't know what I wanted to major in. Now I'm strongly considering majoring in Computer Science. Drysdale was amazing for me. I found about halfway through the course that his lectures were so productive for me, that I remembered almost everything he said in class if I paid attention, and didn't even have to take notes.  My review may be skewed; I really enjoyed the class while I realize some of my classmates struggled. However, I encourage everyone to take this class. I feel that the critical thinking skills required are important to most parts of life.

Prof. Drysdale presents the material in a very logical format. Lectures are easy to follow as long as one is alert (i.e. not sleep-deprived). Course organization is excellent. Take advantage of lab hours (I wish I had more than I did) and make sure you understand concepts.  Students were allowed unlimited (within reason) time on tests, which removed stress and allowed concentration. Coding on paper wasn't too bad, and the tests were easy as long as students understood the concepts (which are definitely worth taking the time to understand, as they're worth large chunks of points on exams). Lecture notes online were thorough and extremely helpful in studying for exams. Cheat sheets (1 page front and back) made exams even more user-friendly.  I learned a lot in this class and recommend it without reservation.

This class was really hard to sit through & pay attention to. By the end I would end up completely not paying attention and then go over the lecture notes kind of... I don't really recommend this because there was a lot of stuff at the end that I didn't understand that well, but there are lecture notes for every class posted on the website that are VERY helpful. The exams are kind of hard, but fortunately the homework is what counts for most of your grade & it's very possible to get near 100's on all of them

lectures can get pretty tedious when it's just going over how a code accomplishes some task, so don't expect to be fully engaged 100% of the time.  though the online notes provided on the cs5 website are AMAZING -- you could skip lectures entirely and not do any of the readings, just read the lecture notes posted online.  they are incredibly comprehensive.
@

I would say do not (DO NOT) take this course if you don't have a strong interest in pursuing Computer Science.  You will spend hours upon hours of dealing with homework and labs that have very little application to life in the real world and the programming you learn, though hard, is not very useful.  Do not look at this as a TAS or TLA, go for a low level ENGS course instead.  This class was an incredible waste of time and effort for me.

Overall, the course was ok. The notes are online with more detail and homework/exam specific explanations than the in class lectures. Drysdale is a horrible lecturer. It would be better to devote the class time to read and understand the notes online. The TAs were very helpful. If you have programming/CS background, this class is very easy.
@

I've heard that CS5 with Cormen is much more bearable. Take it with him (or anyone but Drysdale!) if you can.  I learned NOTHING from his lectures and actually stopped attending them. He posts comprehensive lecture notes online; if you read those, do the assignments, attend small group section meetings, and read the textbook, you'll be fine. (The text is optional, but I found it helpful.) I learned a lot from the TAs in section meetings and the lab.  There are a lot of assignments and the course moves quickly, so don't take it if you can't commit to that or if you're just trying to get a TLA.

I had never taken CS before, and this class has me hooked. The programming is a lot of fun, and the concepts are awe-inspiring.  Can the class be a lot of work? Yes.

For someone with no previous programming experience, this course was a lot of work.

You end up learning a whole lot though and really understanding the material.

CS 5 is a lot of work, anyone will tell you that, but Professor Dysdale made it a better experience. All of his lectures are online so you can pay attention during class instead of just frantically scribbling. Make sure to attend lots of TA sessions and to seriously time manage for this course. However, don't hesitate to go to Professor Drysdale about anything! He is awesome, accomodating, and the sweetest prof. So, if you have to take the class, take it with him!

This was probably the hardest class I have taken so far, but also the mosr rewarding. It is sooo much work... don't take with an easy course load or I don't know how you can handle it. I would spend hours each week on the homework assignments, and the amount of time increased as the term went on.   I found it interesting when I knew what was going on but that wasn't the majority of the time. I didn't always follow what Drysdale was explaining but that could be because I'm not a CS major. The TAs are awesome though - worship them and GO TO THEIR OFFICE HOURS.  I'm glad I took the course, but I'm never EVER taking another CS course again.

This class was a growing experience for me. Probably the biggest challenge of my academic career, even more so than AP Physics! I passed this class, and I am more proud of that than any of my academic accomplishments before This class will blow your mind, if you are not a math or code oriented person. I am a history major who hasn't taken a whole lot of math, and so for me, this class was a very foreign experience. However, I would not have stuck with it if it weren't for Scot Drysdale. The man is amazing. Not only is he just a really nice guy in class, talking to a group of 60 as if had known them all for years, even asking us "so, how's your day going so far?" An incredibly sweet man. He goes slow enough in his lecture that those who are confused are able to ask questions and get some clarity. He even did some funny role playing games to learn about lists. Really great lecturer--made a dry subject interesting. But all of this is nothing compared to his most wonderful quality--patience. I went to see him so much in office hours. He really wanted to see me succeed. He spent so much time with me. I am really greatful for his help.  If anyone wants to take this class for a TAS, or just because they thought it might be interesting, like I did, you are in for a challenge. But this challenge is worth it. This class opened my mind so much to a field I had never even considered.   If you take this class, make sure you take it with Scot Drysdale.

If you've taken AP compsci and did well on the exam this class will probably be boring. But, if you don't go to every class, you'll miss things not covered by the AP and will probably mess up more often on the exams. Homeworks were easy points but exams were a bit harder. If you've programmed before, each homework can be done in a couple hours. If you havn't programmed before this class may be VERY dificult. On one of the exams the high score was 98 and the low was 8. On the final the low was 23.

CS 5 with Drysdale is one of the more difficult courses I have faced thus far at Dartmouth and for a good 9.5 week stretch I hated the course with a passion.  In the end though I am still glad I took the course for several reason, which I will attempt to list in some sort of numerical order  1.  Drysdale is a grand prof.  He knows the material, and more importantly he knows how to teach the material to CS and non-cs people.  His lectures, which he posts online, are a great resource and incredibly detailed, to the extent that going to class is almost trivial.  He gives untimed test, and grades them all by hand for the very next day.  The guy has been sighted helping people out in the CS lab at 2 am the night before a problem set is due.  ANNND he wheres a fanny pack at all times.    2.  Its  a really comprehensive class.  By the end of 10 weeks, you'll have the basis to understanding almost any interaction with the computer  ok I think 2 is enough.  Its a good class

this course was lots of work and very fast paced, and i thought it was extremely interesting.  you learn to do simple programming in the java language which isn't really all that helpful, but the course teaches you more about how to think in computer language.  it's difficult because it is really like learning another language, a very mathematical one. the homework is difficult, but it does a wonderful job of helping you to understand the abstract concepts discussed in class and how to implement them in computer code.  i recommend this course if you have some interest in learning how computer programs work.  i wouldn't necessarily recommend it if you're just looking to fufill your TAS.

Let me start by saying I already had a limited amount of programming experience before I took this course.  Because I already had a bit of experience dealing with programming, I probably had an easier time working with the assignments than some.  This is a great course for an analytical thinker, or one who wants to improve said analytical thinking skills without taking, say, math(bleh).    The assignments can take anywhere from an hour or two (if you take time to plan out what you want to do and know how to program it) to quite a while (if you're totally lost--in which case you should see a TA or Prof. Drysdale).  Prof Drysdale is a good professor; his lectures are pretty representative of what you need to know in the course.  You'll definitely do pretty well on the non-programming questions on tests if you're in class.  I also hear he's good one-on-one for help, along with most of the TAs.  However, because he puts his lecture notes online and because I didn't feel I gained much from going to lecture, I often skipped class.  I did just fine in class and on the assignments--everything you need to know is in lecture notes, I don't know how you'd do anything without them--so you might be able to get away with the same.  All said, CS5 is a good class--if you have an interest in the subject (I enjoy programming a good deal) then you should do fine.  If not, then you can still make do with the help they've got.

This course tried to cover too much material in too short a time, and so took up way too much time.  I spent easily twenty hours a week on "short" assignments, longer homeworks, readings, and studying for tests.  "Short Assignments" took at least three hours.  We all but one of the x-hours and had an hour long recitation section every week, in addition to normal classes.  I never felt like I understood the material until weeks after we had been tested on it.  I would never recommend this course to anyone, unless they already have a strong background in Java or programming similar to Java.

This class was like a rollercoaster. Not like those super cool fun ones though. More like the scary ones that you kick yourself for going on when you realize there's no way out.  Don't get me wrong, this is a great class.  After the first test, i was pretty happy with my above the median grade. The next class, about 20 people dropped and it was all downhill from there. This is a very fast class that builds on what you learned before. If you don't get something, learn it before the next class. Seriously. If you don't you'll be lost for the next week or so, which will make you have no idea whats going on for the next week after that.  The main problem with this class is the grading. There are a lot of short assignments and homeworks, which help you learn the material, but the grading is more or less all or nothing; either your program worked and you got a close to perfect grade, or you couldn't quite get it to work and got little to no credit for workng on it for those 6+ hours.  Drysdale was a very good lecturer and helped everyone understand the material as best he could with demonstrartions, examples, and online notes.   Like most other sciencey courses, there will be 3 or 4 people who know exactly what they're doing and will whip through assignments when you're still trying to make the program stop yelling at you for acting like you know what you're doing when you know that you have no idea how to even start. That gets frustrating, but it helps to latch on with a few other people in the class and help each other out, because what one person doesn't get, someone else will.  This is a great class to take for a challenge, and its amazing the things you can do when you finish the course. If you make it that far.

The class wasn't too bad. The homework assignments were very time consuming but I was very happy with them once I was done.

Do not let the "5" fool you.  This is a demanding class.  While its difficulty may be debatable, simply putting force the energy needed to pass assignments is a feat in and of itself.  The strains of the workload are enhanced by the quality of the lectures.  Though they are organized and comprehensive, I found the lectures so boring that I could barely breathe.  I ended up zoning out and working on a crossword puzzle.  It was quite literally the only way to survive one of those classes.  Had lecture notes not been posted online, I would have dropped the course after the first week.  The material is interesting, however, and the class's text book does a good job picking up where the professor leaves off.   All in all though, unless this is your major, I would not take this course.  If you really want to learn Java, buy a book and teach yourself.

Although it was somewhat time consuming, this class was definitely worth it.  I learned a ton!  Drysdale is a very effective lecturer and knows his stuff, he makes everything really easy to understand.  The HWs were often pretty interesting and really fun to get working and play around with.  The exams were very reasonable if you spent a little bit of time reviewing before you took it - we were allowed to bring a crib sheet to every exam, so no memorization needed at all.  This class caused me the least stress overall this term, just because the material was made so easy to understand and you knew pretty much exactly what was expected of you.  (This varies a little with each grader, and you might lose a couple of "style" points here and there, but nothing to damage your grade enough to care).

If you decide to take CS1, take it with Vasanta! Vasanta is one of the best professors I have had at Dartmouth! She is very knowledgable about CS and encourages students to ask questions. She also realizes that the class is difficult and tries to be encouraging. She also tries to make the class fun through her energy/passion about CS, engagement with students, and jokes/commentary. Even though CS1 is a very challenging class, Vasanta makes it bearable and a pleasant experience.   I recommend taking CS1 if you are willing to put in the time and work for the class. While the class moves very quickly and covers a lot of material, there are always a lot of TA's available to help (lots of office hours). Even if you do not do as well as you would have hoped on the exams, the short assignments and labs will balance your grade. The tests are hard even if you study for them and do all the practice problems; the tests expect you to have a very good foundational understanding of topics and apply this information to harder scenarios. Despite this, I still recommend taking this class with Vasanta! It is important to know a bit about CS (or try it out) with CS being such a hot field.

Vasanta is a really great professor. She wants each and every person to do well in cs, and will take the time to walk through every concept with you. She'll even get annoyed if people aren't asking questions/aren't engaged with the class. She gave us tons of practice problems before the exams. She is probably one of my favorite profs. Unlike the other two reviews though, I think the only downside to her class is her tests. As someone with no coding experience, and who cs did not always come naturally, I felt the tests were always fair except for one question. She seemed to put one question on every exam that she knew only people with either previous coding experience or who were extremely good as cs would understand. This wouldn't be an issue if that question didn't count for 20/100 of the points, and it seemed impossible to get partial credit (maybe it was just my TA). Either way, do the python text readings and try to do the practice problems over time. Even if you average a C on the exams, it's possible to end with a B.

Vasanta is generous and kindhearted, always willing to speak with students one-on-one during office hours and to ensure that everyone has every opportunity to earn an A in the class (although the minimum in 19S for getting an A was a 95%, which is daunting and not all that accessible). While the exams usually have one question that is beyond the reach of most students, the labs and short assignments, while also challenging, usually allow students to balance their grade to somewhere in the B-to-A range, assuming exam performance isn't too poor. Go to office hours if you're stuck—go all the time, in fact—and take the class with an NRO set if you're concerned about the difficulty. Even if you don't plan on taking CS after CS 1, you should take the course solely to learn Python, as it's growing so much more relevant as a qualification for employment, even for jobs where it might not immediately seem useful.

The class is fair grading wise because everyone gets high scores on the labs and short assignments and the tests are fair, but it's a lot of work. The labs and short assignments are very tough, especially near the end of the course. They also aren't really related to the test material which was super frustrating. Vasanta is one of the nicest professors I've had but the lectures can get very boring and sometimes are relatively unclear. That said CS is very practical and a lot of people love the class/continue on in the field, so I would recommend taking it for the lab credit and for the exposure. Just expect some frustrations along the way and consider setting an NRO if you're worried about the grade.

Course This was an AMAZING class! I thought that the pacing was very reasonable, even a bit slow, which was nice. I came into this class knowing literally NOTHING about programming, so I thought I would be at a disadvantage, but my lack of experience didn't hurt me at all. Prof. Farid doesn't assume any prior knowledge at all.   Professor Prof. Farid is an incredible professor. He is super clear, funny, receptive to questions, and makes the class feel small despite its large size. I have nothing but good things to say about him. He's also very accessible at office hours, and he answers emails at lightning speed. And he isn't full of himself either.  Workload Here's the basic breakdown  9 "Short Assignments" -- usually short programming assignments; usually due the next class day. 4 Labs -- longer programming assignments; usually get over a week to do them.  Other than that there isn't a whole lot to do. I found it useful to study over my notes (and the lecture notes posted online) after every class, just to solidify everything. (And because CS is cumulative, this is important and saves time in the long run.) Some people found the workload to be crazy, but I didn't think that was the case. Here's what I think is the key DON'T START ASSIGNMENTS THE NIGHT BEFORE THEY ARE DUE! That's super stressful, and it makes your brain turn to mush. And programming is hard when your brain has gone to mush. I found that the assignments took a much shorter amount of time when I started them early.

Decided to become a Comp Sci major after taking this class with Farid! Coursework is reasonable, 1 lab assignment (about 4 - 6 hours) with 1 - 3 short assignments (can take anywhere between 15 minutes and 2 hours) every week. 1 midterm and 1 final. Workload is manageable but make sure to stay on top of it since there are always assignments due every 3 days. TAs and prof very available to help outside of class if you can't figure them out on your own. The material is very interesting and Prof. Farid does an excellent job of motivating students to pursue further studies in CS by expanding the lectures into the application of the concepts we were learning in class.  Highly recommended.

@

/course/680
Prof Jayanti is the best teacher I have ever had. He is so dedicated and easygoing. He opens extra office hours just to make sure everyone knows the basics. However, the class is hard especially for the fall term because there are so many people who have years of experience of CS in high school take the course. They make the curve steeper. For the two midterms, the class's performance was so polarized that half of the students were above 80+, while the other half was around 60, which made our mean around 10 marks lower than the median. I don't recommend people who did not have CS experience before take it in the fall term- you will feel very left behind even for the very first few weeks because your peers already doing this for years.
@
Prasad Jayanti
/course/680
100% do not recommend taking this course in the fall if you do not have prior CS experience. You'll feel left behind really early on and will have to work a lot harder than everyone else to achieve anywhere near the median. Don't let the median fool you either; there are two medians for this class -- one is those with experience, one is without, without a lot of people in the middle range. Many people will drop the class and the disparities between experience and inexperienced will only widen as the term goes on. I (thankfully) NROed this class with the advice of my tutor, which is the only reason I stuck with this course until the end. That being said, Jayanti is an enthusiastic and engaging prof.

I learned so much from this class. Brooks is extremely knowledgeable and a great lecturer, and he's always very friendly and helpful during office hours.Aside from a few classes where Brooks will split the class in half to form discussion groups, the class is entirely lecture-based. You're assigned several readings each class, which can be a bit lengthy at times but are manageable as long as you plan to get them done before the midterms. Your final grade in the class is composed of two midterms and a final 1100 word paper. As long as you pay close attention to the way Brooks organizes his lectures, you'll do fine on the midterms. The only downside to having Brooks is that he takes almost the entire term to hand back your first midterm, and he doesn't provide feedback on it.

I really enjoyed this class. Prof. Brooks is awesome! If you go to lecture, the class is pretty easy. The whole grade is based on two midterms and a final paper. You do not really have to read on time, but make sure to read before the midterms. The only hard thing is that he is a very slow grader. Overall a really good class though and not too hard.
@
Stephen Brooks
/course/1451
Really, really great class. Would highly recommend it to anyone, particularly if you can get Brooks. The material covered is interesting, and Brooks makes his lectures very easy to follow. Brooks is really friendly and occasionally jokes around in lecture. Fair warning, he can be a little impersonal (didn't know anyone's names), doesn't give much feedback (he's all scores, no comments), and never grades anything (have my final grade, but have no idea how I did on the second midterm or the final paper). I found the workload manageable overall, but there were definitely some more reading-heavy nights in my opinion. Finally, this is a class you'll do well in if you're good at memorizing--which you'll need to do with precision to ace the midterms. Pay attention in lecture, do the readings, and go to study group sessions before the midterms (you don't really need to go any other time). Take the class, so far it is the best one I've taken at Dartmouth.

Took it since I heard so many great things about it. I think it was OK, give you an overview of international politics, what the main theories are as well as the current international landscape. Prof. Brooks was very subjective however, we spent one whole lecture on talking about how China will never be able to surpass the US. Workload was pretty heavy with readings due everyday, one midterm, and one final paper.

Course Gov 5 was such an amazing course, especially with Prof. Brooks. I highly recommend this course to any Dartmouth students. I've heard similarly good things about Wohlforth, and I'm sure he's good as well.   Professor Prof. Brooks is one of the nicest professors I've ever had at Dartmouth. He's really chill and has really tailored his course so that everyone can learn international relations. His lectures are extremely well organized and easy to follow and he never ceases to bore the class.  Workload The reading is really manageable and the exams are fairly easy to study for. There are two midterms and a take-home final. The midterms mostly consist of material from the notes, but they also include some details from the reading. Because of this, I'd highly recommend doing all the readings. The take-home final synthesizes everything from the class in a short but sweet essay. Brooks gives you the entire exam period to complete it, so if you have assessments in other classes, you should be fine.
@
Stephen Brooks
/course/1451
This class was divided into 2 parts - part 1 was IR theory, and part 2 was "current affairs," i.e. problems facing the world today.  Brooks is fantastic - he's interesting, funny and extremely knowledgeable. He is old-fashioned though; he speaks from a lecturn, does not use powerpoint, and forbids the use of laptops. But that wasn't a problem at all because he was incredibly well-organized.  Your grade is based on 2 midterms (40% each) and a final paper (20%, max. 1200 words).  The only gripe - he takes a couple of weeks to grade the exams.
@

Professor Brooks is a very good lecturer. He occasionally jokes around, but is usually serious and articulate. He often repeats himself in several different ways until you know exactly what he is trying to say. His lectures are incredibly well structured, and he goes by a strict outline that he writes up on the blackboard. He pauses between sections of his lecture to write headings on the board. Clearly, he is incredibly knowledgeable on the subject, as he has written several books. These follow his same lecture style articulate yet concise.  The class was not too hard. There are 2 midterms and a final cumulative paper. The midterms consist of fill-in-the-blank and short answer, both of which are straightforward and pulled right from his lectures.  I highly recommend this class if you are interested in government/international relations and want a course with little reading but effective lectures.

this course was amazing. although some complain about Brooks' grading system (there are very few evaulations and the fill in the blank on the exam can seem random), Brooks' extensive knowledge and interest in the subject are inspiring and noteworthy.

This was hands down the best course I took all of mly freshman year.  Professor Brooks is incredible--such a clear and inspiring lecturer.  Even though it was a 50 person class, he managed to get everyone to participate.

The course includes a midterm and a final paper of 1600 words.

Somehow, despite having very solid background knowledge of the course material (to the extent that I had read and understood most of the readings before setting foot in this class), I ended up struggling. This was mostly due to the structure of the midterm, which I found incredibly frustrating it did not seem designed to test a student's actual understanding of the material as much as it seemed to test a student's ability to perfectly regurgitate lecture. I felt that I was heavily penalized on the exam because I had not developed silly pneumonic devices to remember the exact seven "causes" for something or other. Perhaps this was particularly bothersome for me because, having an understanding of the material, the natural way for me to study was not to memorize language and think of it almost as I would a math class (memorizing rules and spitting them out). I can understand how a student with less experience in the material might study in a way more conducive to doing well on that midterm. But it was incredibly frustrating for me, and I don't think it was because my prior understanding coupled with effort put into the course was somehow insufficient. I think it's telling that, after the exam, in order to try to understand some of the questions I was unsure of, when I asked a government major honors' student (one of six or seven, I believe) he didn't have the slightest clue how to answer those questions. I understand that there is a certain burden on the student taking the course to be more intimate with the immediate details and readings, but given that this is supposed to be an intro course, the fact that it does not seem to accurately reflect the knowledge base of one of the department's top students seems relevant. In explaining my frustrations to others, the most common responses I get are "I hated Gov5" or "I hate intro classes." All in all, I was 1,000% sure that I would be a government major coming into Dartmouth. Now, I have severe reservations - the material is substantially less interesting to me and the way I have seen it taught at Dartmouth (which includes a high-level government class I took in the fall) is not consistent with the way I learn - or, to put it another way, I no longer feel this department is as strong as I once did. Midterms like the one in this class are a crutch - they are not attempts to genuinely engage the students' understanding of the course material.

The readings are a little long, but you don't necessarily have to read all of them, and you can definitely see where the class is going. Take this class with Brooks!!

Brooks was great. He gave 5 random pop quizzes, of which only 4 counted and the quizzes were ridiculously easy. You don't even have to do all the reading! For a couple of the quizzes, I just skimmed the titles and still got all of the questions correct! The midterm was also ridiculously easy. Pay attention in class, take good notes, and skim the readings and you'll do fine.  Warning Brooks didn't return the midterm until we handed in the final paper (also pretty easy, only 1600 words). But the midterm was so easy, very few people were actually worried about it.

Professor Brooks gave interesting, engaging lectures. THe material is pretty straightforward, and the midterm was so easy i was concerned everyone would get and A.

Not only is Brooks super-organized, but he is also really funny.

He really is one of the better profs at Dartmouth.  There were several pop reading quizzes which were super easy as well as one midterm and one paper. I wasn't a fan of how the course was evaluated- I thought it would have been better with more grades. You dont find out your midterm grade until you are writing/have finished writing your paper, so you dont know how you are doing in the class.  Still, I would definitely recommend this gov class- its a pretty easy third course and fun as well.

As a caveat to this review, I should say that I have an unusually strong interest in International Politics so Professor Brooks probably didn't have to do much to inspire me to be passionate about the subject; that being said, Brooks was AWESOME. His lectures were really interesting and he moved at a fair pace. He has a great sense of humor and he does a great job of breaking down difficult concepts to make them accessible. He is also a good guy and the few times I talked to him outside of class, he was always willing to help. He's really one of those professors who is a very very renowned published scholar; yet, still is very talented at teaching. I would highly recommend this course.  As for the course itself, the readings were all pretty managable; he makes sure to cut them down to be as short as possible so that everyone can do them. As far as the grading, there is just a midterm and a final paper. The midterm is sort of functionally equivalent to a final because you get it so late in the term. It consisted of 20 fill-in-the-blanks and 3 essay questions. I thought the grading was very fair. The final paper isn't too tough if you've taken good notes on the readings, but leave yourself enough time to do it.

Brooks kept the long lectures, which in the hands of another teacher may have been excruciating, relatively entertaining and very interesting, making it hard not to tune in to what he was lecturing about.  He also took an unusual amount of time incorporating the class into discussions about the topics we were learning about, especially for an intro lecture class.  Overall an excellent intro class to international politics.  One complaint I didn't receive any grade until after the last day of classes, which made it hard to gauge how complete my understanding was, which for me is one of the more useful aspects of grades in general
@

Brooks is kind of the man. Best class I've taken at Dartmouth, out of all the reading I think there was one article I didn't find interesting.  Brooks is fantastic about the reading...he gives you exact page numbers to read so you don't waste your time reading a bunch of unnecessary material. There's usually a reading from a textbook that gives you the necessary background (it's the most interesting, least convoluted textbook I've ever read) and then you read a few articles from different viewpoints on the topic.  The majority of the class is dedicated to the different IR theories, then there's a short section on the global economy and then you have a midterm.   There are short pop quizzes on the readings, but most of the time they're something along the lines of "what was the chapter in the textbook on?" Nevertheless, DO the reading. If you do, the exam and paper are easy and class will be that much more interesting.  After the midterm, you spend about 4 or 5 classes on different problems facing the world. Genocide, poverty, nuclear proliferation, terrorism, and the environment. They're really interesting as well because you sort of apply everything you've learned over the term to these different topics. Then you have a 1600 word paper due at the end of reading period.  Truly fantastic class, take it for sure if you're a gov major, take it even if you aren't.

Unlike many students who gush about Brook's greatness, I will tell the truth about him and his class...  Brooks' lectures are great, he's nice, and really good at explaining the readings/material, but he does not go to office hours and makes excuses for it---that is just unacceptable to me because all of the professors have lives, families, children, etc. but many of them make themselves available to students.  So he needs to work on that big time.  I also feel that he can get a little lazy...there is just no way one can grade students' midterms so late!! They were worth 40% of the final grade, and kids were unsure as to whether to drop or not. I honestly believe that he just randomly assigned grades at the end of the course regardless of whether one went to class or not...
@

very interesting course, Brooks is great! His lectures and the course overall are very organized. The class had about 50 students which allowed for great discussions on certain topics.  There were a few reading quizzes (usually one simple question), a midterm about six weeks into the term (kind of late but it worked well with the topics), and then a final 5 page paper.   I would definitely recommend this course, even if you're not a government major.
@
Stephen Brooks
/course/1451
This course is based on 5 grades- 10% is 3 pop quizzes with 1 or 2 word answers that are really easy to test if you did the readings. Often the answer is as easy as reading the title of the reading, and he drops one of quizzes. The final is 50%, its a paper that isn't too bad and you have a few days to write it. The midterm is the killer. There's 25 multiple choice and the rest is short answer. The multiple choice was okay and straightforward, but the short answers that could be interpreted in different ways and are graded irrationally. the class is also filled with anxious freshmen and govt majors who take themselves way to seriously and make the class insanely boring. brooks is a boring prof and his lectures will put you to sleep. thankfully towards the end of the term we watched a few dvds.

This course was ridiculously easy until the first and only midterm which was really late. The midterm was 40% of the grade and the final paper was 50% (4 in class quizzes were 10%) so the entire grade was decided in the last 3 weeks of class.

Why does everyone take Gov 5? Everyone who took it before me told me how interesting it was.   They didn't take it with Brooks.   He makes sure that the material has absolutely no relevance to real world events. So forget studying interesting current event because all you get is theory. Brooks proved to me that International Relations theory is no more than that-- some professor's theory that doesn't have any affect or relevance outside of academia.   He focuses most of the class on economic theories which I found pretty boring. I tried really hard to stay awake in lectures but his voice put me to sleep every time. He seems like a nice guy but he is a horrible lecturer. Even when he gets excited about something or makes a joke, his voice gets sucked up into the vacuum that is the pointlessness of International Relations.  I found his grading extremely unfair, especially the final essay. It is a large class so he doesn't have much time to spend grading them so he pretty much just skimmed them, circled random things, and gave it a grade based on how much you regurgitated what he said. Applying and expanding on what we learned resulted in lower grades.  If you really want to take this course, because everyone else tells you how wonderful it is, at least wait for another prof.

"Ohh government is so stupid. The US should just stop intervening in other countries issues. I am against war. There should be no war. Politics leads to war. Politics is dumb and useless."   This class will thoroughly challenge your assumptions about the way states should and do interact. Before taking this class I knew absolutely nothing about international relations and strongly believed in just not going to war as a solution to the problems facing the world today.  This class will present you first with a theoretical background for thinking about how states interact. Are states ruthlessly self-interested? Is there the possiblility of inter-state cooperation? Is identity socially constructed?  After addressing a theoretical background, Brooks walks you through the concept of "globalization" and how it relates to the "global economy." Lastly, presenting you with the major problems facing all states; poverty, the environment and the threat of total nuclear destruction.  The world is getting smaller. Take international relations and get a world perspective.

If you are at all interested in international politics, definitely take this class with Brooks. You won't regret it.

Professor Brooks is fine. He has a sense of humor, he enjoys his topic, and he's reasonable. He doesn't give more reading than is necessary, and the small amount of reading that he does give can in turn be cut down--you only really have to read the beginning paragraph and the last, skimming between. His tests make sure you understand. There's nothing too hard here. However, he's not the most exciting lecturer. I was also disappointed that we didn't analyze current situations or past ones. Brooks actually seems to go out of his way NOT to do so, which was unfortunate because that's what I thought the class would be about. Since we didn't apply the knowlege, it felt a little like a class based literally on the study of b.s.. It's a good class, though. Not a great class, but a good one.

This is a very good course, especially for non majors as it is both interesting and useful.  Prof. Brooks is an excellent and organized lecturer; the readings are well-selected and offer different points of view on a variety of topics (security, realism, liberalism, the environment, etc.).    My only complaint is that the course seemed a little too large.  Maybe it would be better if this were a 50 person course (this term, it had 100 people in it), as this would allow Prof. Brooks to grade the midterms more quickly, and allow for more in class discussion, more opportunities to talk with him one-on-one, etc.  In any case, the size of the course was not a huge factor.

Prof. Brooks is an awesome lecturer and a great intellectual. he is very renowned for his area of expertise. his lectures are very interesting, insightful, and easy to follow. sometimes the reading assignments get tedious, not b/c they're hard, but b/c there are pop quizzes, but those should not be a problem if you do a quick read of the assignments. this class is definitely one of the best classes i've taken at dartmouth so far.   there are 2 midterms, pop quizzes, and a final essay... the midterms and quizzes are seriously not a problem at all, as long as you consistently do the reading.. and the final essay is very interesting and fun to write.

Prof Brooks' lectures are extremely clear, organized and interesting. Even though the readings were focused on theories, his lectures brought up real world applications. The workload is extremely manageable. There are two tests and a final paper, the tests are really fair. I learned a lot from this course and I'm glad I took it with Prof Brooks.

I loved this course, so much so that I want to be a Gov major.  Brooks is way into the material, as you can tell by the assignment of HIS OWN  WRITINGS for homework.  That said, the lectures are great.  The  readings aren't long, but they're essential.  The exams are a gift, they're  that easy.  So what are you waiting for, sign up for it.

brooks was a pretty average prof but the material was great.  this was my first intro class and the theory was quite useful for reevaluative things that i held to be true

Govy 5 is a very good intro to IR. It's not too hard, and Brooks manages to cut out a lot of the bullshit readings that are so common within the department. He pares much of the reading so that you only have to read the important parts.  My two complaints for an otherwise interesting course were that there was very little analytical thinking done, even on the midterm exams, and that Brooks was mildly pompous. Definitely a good class to take though.

Professor Brooks is an excellent lecturer and teacher. One of the things I really appreciated was how perfectly organized his lectures were, making it easy to take good notes and follow what he was saying. He clearly knew what he was talking about, given that he wrote one of the books that we read parts of. The readings were cut down to a manageable amount about 30-50 pages of reading due for every class. There were random pop quizzes, but if you did the reading there was no way you weren't going to get the one question he asked. The two midterms were pretty easy with fill in the blanks and short answer questions and the final paper was a little vague but ended up making you think about important stuff. I definitely recommend this class with Professor Brooks because it will definitely inspire interest in the subject!

Prof. Brooks definitely sparked my interest for international relations. It's hard teaching an intersting intro class as a 100 person lecture, but Prof. Brooks does a great job of keeping the students engaged.

The reading for the class is very interesting and pretty easy. It seems that the amount of reading assigned by this prof is much lower than the average. The lectures are well-organized, but almost too structured, and can get really dry.

The lectures are extremely well organized.  You learn the basics of international politics.  The workload is definitely manageable.  All around, a good intro course.  Watch out for tough 2nd Midterm though, lots of random questions.

Professor Brooks is a very effective lecturer who displays an outline of each day's lecture on the overhead while he speaks. This allows for very organized and clear notes. I found the material a bit theoretical in the beginning, but fascinating by the second half of the term. If you try hard, you can apply the theories to the real world. However, I CANNOT EXCUSE PROFESSOR BROOKS FOR FAILING TO RETURN OUR SECOND MIDTERMS BEFORE WE HAD TO TURN IN THE FINAL PAPER!!! This is extremely bad pedagogy, since students can't learn from their mistakes before they are re-tested. Also, the final paper prompt was extremely vague "analyze the world's greatest problem, and describe which IR theory best solves it" in 1500 words.
@
Stephen Brooks
/course/1451
Brooks manages to take an interesting subject and turn it into extremely boring lectures. They were very well organized and easy to understand, but failed to inspire interest in the subject. My main complaint with him was his grading. His midterms required you to memorize his lectures word for word, and if you didn't, he penalized you greatly. He never returned our final paper grades until prompted, and when he did, there were no comments (not one word) on my paper, yet many points were taken off. How does he expect us to learn or improve? Not to mention the fact that the final paper was an extremeley vague "Solve the world's biggest problem in four pages."  In short, take this class with Valentino if you want to actually learn something!!!

If  you're going to take Gov5, take it with Stam. Brooks is probably a good prof to take a small seminar with, but his lectures are extremely disengaging. He looks at the floor, doesn't enunciate, and he'll say  "IR scholars', 'vis-a-vis,' or 'at any rate,'" at least 10 times each class period. Brooks is all theory, no real application--it's like he studies the papers "IR Scholars produce," not real world events. The first words in one of his readings were "IR scholars have tended to..." I DON'T WANT TO STUDY IR SCHOLARS, I WANT TO STUDY IR!!!  Theory, theory, theory. Other than that, Brooks is very fair, and if you do the readings, you'll do fine on the midterms. He also changed the final question this term, so don't jump to conclusions abou what you've read on other reviews. Gov people won't enjoy this course with Brooks, but Philosophy people might.

Professor Brooks is a clear, dynamic lecturer who makes it very easy to pay attention during class. He knows a lot about international politics and inspires his students to learn more. He also has a good sense of humor. The readings were a bit long, but they all had a coherent theme which made them easy to read. The exams are fair, but short, and they don't cover all that much information, so it's important to cover all topics while studying. Know the class notes cold!!!  The topic for the final paper was broad. Overall, this is an excellent intro course.

Stephen Brooks does an uninspiring job of lecturing in this class. Although his class discussions were more enlightening, Brooks preaches in a monotone that just begs the listener to fall asleep. And when you wake up from that sleep, he's still on the same subject.   The class, or maybe it's all gov 5 classes, is focused on surface probing of IR theories which are rarely applied to current events.  Brooks, under the advice of some b-r-i-g-h-t students changed the format of his test to all essays. He takes his sweet time with grading so don't expect to know your grade till the last possible moment.   Perhaps the class would improve if it wasn't overflowing with the 100 students that flock to govy 5 every term.

This was a really interesting intro to international relations!  Prof Brooks is really a great lecturer- his lectures are always very clear and very good at explaining the readings.  He also does a surprisingly good job keeping a 100 person class awake, he's not very vivacious but he is very interseting and he really cares, which is wonderful.  The work isn't too hard- you do need to do most of the readings but if you do them you should be fine, and the tests are very fair. I definitely recommend this class if you are a gov major or if you're just interested in starting to understand the crazy stuff that's happening out there...

Brooks is fantastic.  He adds some humor to the lectures, and the readings are very interesting.  He keeps his opinions to himself and presents pros and cons for each IR theory.  This class is great.

The lectures may not always be terribly exciting, but they're really well organized and easy to understand. The assignments are very to-the-point; Brooks makes an effort to cut out unnecessary material so that you don't get bogged down with work. I really liked Brooks, and this class was interesting enough to make me consider a Govt major.

Great Gov intro class.  Very interesting (take it with Brooks, who may not be the most interesting lecturer but whose syllabus is much, much more organized than Stam).  It's also not too much work as long as you stay on top of the readings and show up to class.
@
Stephen Brooks
/course/1451
I was really eager to take this class and  although it wasn't exactly what I thought it would be it was still a solid course.  Brooks tries his best to limit the readings to managable amounts and does pretty well.  He has a few random reading quizzes to make sure people are actually doing them, but if you at least scan the readings you'll still do well as they are extremely easy.  The course made me a little uneasy because the only grades were a midterm, a final, and the 10% quiz grade but Brooks seems to be a fair grader.  He gives very organized lectures that are very informative, but at times he rambles a bit and is a little dry.  Overall it was definitely a worthwhile course.
@
Stephen Brooks
/course/1451
Prof Brooks's lectures can be slow at times, but he's very thorough and explains everything clearly, and the last few lectures he gives are definitely more interesting than some of the beginning ones.    There is a lot of reading assigned, I had to do all of it to get by in the course but I know other people in the class managed to skim it and do fine.    Brooks gives "pop" quizzes that literally have one word answers to check that you did the reading and are in class, and a midterm and final that are multiple choice and managable - the final had a couple essay questions as well.  Good intro course, good prof, managable workload
@

Despite the fact that this was a large intro, professor brooks facilitated really interesting and detailed discussions, more typical of a small class. though i didn't love all the lectures, that had more to do with the material than the professor.

The subject matter is very interesting. The first couple lectures are a little dry, but once Brooks got into the meat of the course it became  more enjoyable. Brooks is a very well-organized lecturer, much to the benefit of the students.   You know you have a good prof when you're afraid to miss class not because of a fear of a grading penalty, but because you know that by missing a class, you just passed up a golden opportunity to learn insightful knowledge that you can't find elsewhere.

I wasn't the biggest fan of IR theory when I started the class. I thought it was too abstract and vague to ever help me understand foreign policy. I joked that IR theorists spent their time calculating how decreasing the US nuclear stockpile by one weapon would effect our deterant. However, Prof Brooks was such a good teacher that made me become interested in material I normally dislike. He is funny, creative, nice, and innovative. He doesn't recycle lectures from year to year as many professors do, but changes them to address the current political climate. This was not just true for the terrorism aspect of the course, but also for global trade and other topics, which he discussed in light of the Qatar trade talks that occured during the term. Overall, he is a great guy and I would definately recommend his class. One caveat-he is a very hard grader. What I thought was an extremely easy midterm turned into a somewhat difficult one as a result of his high expectations. However, I think that if I had know what he was looking for in advance (which is incredible precision), I think I would have been fine.

You should take the course. Want objective proof, visit his office in Silsby. Gaze at the shelf and just notice some of the titles on the shelf. Then ask him some questions about security or the International Economy and watch how he boils tough concepts into graspable bits of information. Wait don't get too exited because then he exepects you to use the information to form an opinion about global issues. Even though its a large course, get in there (if you can) and take it!

Brooks was just that a good prof. I wasn't entranced by his lectures, but I felt a sort of connection with the young professor. He makes great jokes--but usually only one or two per class, so you have to listen closely. I had a hard time staying awake, but that was definitely due to my poor sleeping habits rather than Brooks. The man is very likeable, even though the intro class may get a little boring at times, especially at the beginning. Give it a chance, though, don't give up at the beginning because it gets better.

This class is definitely worth taking, even if you aren't interested in government.  The material is interesting and applicable to the news from every day.  Professor Brooks makes a concious effort to give very organized lectures which helps in making the material clear.  He makes corny jokes that some days will keep you laughing, but others just leave you unamused.  He gives one midterm and a final essay.  Watch out on the midterm he's a picky grader.  His reading quizzes may scare some people off at first but they're easy as long as you did the reading--nothing to fear.

I signed up for Govy 5 with a not-too clear idea of what I wanted to get out of the course.  I ended up loving it.  The readings were interesting, and there was not a ridiculous amount.  Professor Brooks' lectures were by far the highlight of the course.  He is a funny guy, and makes lecture worth staying awake for.  He is also knowledgable in this field of study and very accessible for questions, office hours, and blitzed questions.  I knew absolutely nothing about International Politics before this class, and now I am shocked by how much I know.
@

I would certainly recommend taking this class with Professor Brooks.  He is an excellent lecturer, and he really made the material interesting.  His class was helpful but not extremely demanding, as Brooks made sure to assign only relevant pages in our books.  Oftentimes our homework consisted of reading one page excerpts from ten different sections in a book.  Brooks clearly puts a lot of time into being a teahcer, and this encouraged me to put time into being a student.  If you have any interest whatsoever in international relations, I highly recommend taking this class.  Even if it doesn't sound intriguing at first, I am sure you would take something away from Govt. 5 with Prof. Brooks.

I would strongly recommend this class to any Dartmouth student, especially in light of the September 11th attacks.  Prof. Brooks is very enthusiastic about the material, and is very fair in his assessments.  A class you should take before graduating, even if you have no interest in government.

Prof. Brooks did an excellent job of planning out the syllabus and sticking to it so that we covered tons of interesting stuff and it all made sense.

I dont think it would have been the same without Prof. Brooks, he makes the class.

...and the dude looks like Ed Norton from "Fight Club".  One of my favorite classes ar Dartmouth thus far. Prof. Brooks is an extrenely bright guy who knows he stuff pack and teachers right at the students level. He lectures well (at times using (Gasp!) humor), takes care of business, and puts the ball in the student's court. If you want a lot out of his class, you do the readings and think about what you're learning, talk about it with your friends. If you're there for the ride, that's cool too, he doesn't mind.   Especially in light of 9/11, take this course, gain some perspective, think.

/course/1451
Very interesting material, especially in light of recent events. Good stuff to know, and it'll be hard to forget.  Readings were relevant and interesting, and Prof. Brooks deliberately gave much much less than the average government course. The midterm was ridiculously easy, although the grading was pretty harsh (which is bad for all the freshmen who take this course). Lectures are very interesting as well, but could use some variety (i.e. maybe discussion, etc). There's only a midterm and a final paper in this class, and 99% of the grade rests on them, so there's some pressure.  Otherwise, it's an easy easy course which i recommend to anyone interested in current events or needs an INT distrib.

Press is an incredible lecturer - despite his lack of organization in communication (must email him several times to get a response) his classroom and his lectures are organized, engaging and super informed. He brings very interesting personal experience and perspective to his classes, while still providing a fair and factual lecture, giving students an opportunity to form their own opinions and discuss. He's very committed to improving his students' writing and takes the time to meet with everyone if you want to meet with him. Favorite class at Dartmouth so far, highly recommend.

Fantastic course, and totally turned me on to the subject of Government. A lot of reading, but Press covers everything read in his lectures, which are extremely engaging and entertaining. We had reading quizzes, but I'm pretty sure he didn't grade them, which meant that the only graded material was 2 5-page papers. Even if you don't enjoy Government, this course is eye-opening and Press is my favorite prof here at Dartmouth.

Prof Press is a really knowlegeable and responsive to students. Definetly visit him during office hours. Although I loved the class and would recommend it, it is a lot of reading. The tests and essay are so straightforward that you need a very deep understanding of the material to get a good grade. The only criticism I have of Prof Press is that his expectations for what he wants to read in an answer are too specific.

press makes for an interesting govt 5 class that goes by quickly and you learn the material too. the only thing is that press brushes aside some of the negative consequences of economic globalization for less/undeveloped countries a bit too quickly, but overall he is committed to staying neutral and just giving us the facts and letting us decide. just make sure you keep up with the readings!

This is a great class that any student who wants to be well-educated about the world should take.  The readings are really interesting and have good variety.  I was really impressed with how well Prof. Press presented all the sides of a debate.  He was very explicit about not wanting to "indoctrinate" us, but just giving us the tools and framework to devise our own opinions.  One lecture was devoted to how to write a good paper, which was very helpful because he expected a specific format.  He gives fantastic lectures.  My biggest complaint would be that he always seemed to dash into class a couple minutes after 10.  He was really not very available and pretty bad at getting the midterm back to us in a timely manner.  But I was able to overlook these (minor) details because he really is a great prof overall.

The one big drawback of ths class is that there is a TON of reading for every class and you actually need to do all of it, as he has random reading quizzes that are worth a fairly substantial amount and if you don't do the reading you will fail them.  On the other hand, Press is a great and energetic lecturer, and kept it relatively entertaining for the most part.  The two exams were not too difficult, and there was only one paper (though he has very specific paper requirements that are different from any class I've ever taken).  On the whole it's a good class, but you have to be ready to do the reading.

This class is too big to ever be good.  Press is not a bad lecturer when he is prepared and focused, but he oriented his lectures too much around student questions and comments, which meant the class was spent on irrelevant comments, the lectures kept getting sidetracked, and we never covered all of the material.  The readings that Press selects are also badly chosen and don't really give a good or representative introduction to their subject areas.  I think the size and nature of this class mean it's kind of impossible for it to be good.  Too bad it's a requirement.

This class was way too large.  Professor Press tried to lead discussions during class, which was ridiculous and a waste of time for most people, because obviously all 100 students aren't going to be able to participate.  All he did was go over arguments presented in readings...hardly ever expanding upon them or filling in the gaps between readings.    I chose to major in government because professors seem genuinely interested in interacting with students, helping them learn the material and improve their writing.  This class was none of these (probably a fault of the size and not entirely Press's teaching).

Press is extremely fair and considers all sides of an argument.  He works dilligently to improve his quiz questions, and wants you to enjoy while you learn.  He taught us how to write a paper (5 pager worth 40% of your grade, and tough but well worth it).  The reading quizes are too hard, and I did all the reading, but they aren't worth too much of your grade. Take this class, take it from Press.  He is excellent, you will learn a lot, and you won't feel indoctrinated.  Press says that the point of this class is to get you thinking, and he is right.

All we had was a midterm, a final 5 page paper, and an easy final for our grade, with some easy reading quizzes here and there.  That's it.

Although Professor Press is brilliant (and presents issues in a balanced way), the readings for Govt. 5 can be difficult and/or boring.

Far too much emphasis on exactly which author said what. Readings are helpful tools to build ideas, concepts, critical thinking, etc. Not much application of knowledge gained from the reading WHATSOEVER in the midterm/final. Paper was alright. Midterm was difficult in both grading and its ambiguous wording of some questions.
@
Daryl Press
/course/1451
If you pay attention and skim about half the reading, you'll get a good grade. With the amount of reading assigned (120 pages per class or so), it's easy to overstudy-- especially since Press doesn't go over more than one or two articles per class, and often entirely skips lecturing on the reading.  Overall exams were super easy compared to the assigned reading.

This is a great course and the prof was really nice.  The exams were pretty easy but the readings sucked since there were so many of them. My advice....don't do all the readings. You can get by skimming most and taking notes in class. Cool class....take it.

Take this class! Both the material and professor were great. It was my favorite class in my freshman fall. The class is divided into two sections international security and international political economy. It was a lot of reading. Had to download from Blackboard and print out probably 100 pages to read for each class session. The readings were very interesting and were used as a background for the class session's discussion that day. Press was awesome. He was a great lectuerer. Never dry. Always funny and responsive to the studetns. Take this class!

Daryl Press was very interesting - made a 2 hour 10A whiz by.  I definately recommend taking a course with him - this course alone inspired me to take more government courses.  However, it was a large class, and difficult to find time to meet with him outside of class.  Although when we did meet he was very helpful.

Very interesting, and the work load was light! There's a fair amount of reading, but it was, for the most part, covered in the lectures. Press is a great teacher, he ran the 104 person lecture class almost like a discussion.  He was very interactive, encouraging questions and responses.  He also is good about getting students to challenge the material presented to them and form their own opinions.

Press is very entertaining and made lectures interesting and clear. However, I feel the course material (and even the lectures) got progressively less interesting as the class went on. Some of the readings are very lengthy and boring and will drive you crazy. I don't feel like I learned that much, and if someone were to ask me "what did you learn from this course," I would say "experts aren't sure what to think of international polictics and there is a lot of disagreement in the field." I probably wouldn't have taken it, except for the fact that Press was so personable and entertaining.

Don't get me wrong- this class was very interesting to a lot of people.  I just realized it wasn't for me.  I dug a hole for myself and just didn't really do the readings, thinking I'd just listen to lectures and I'd be find (like I did in high school- because I'm a freshman, afterall)....anyhow...Press is a brilliant man and gives great lectures.  If you're going to take this class, it's definitely worth it if you're interested in the material.  Just, DO THE WORK! because you don't want to end up scrambling at the end of the term, like me.

This was a great course. The readings were very interesting, and all lectures were useful. This course has sold me into being a Govvie Major.  There is a good bit of readings, but it isn't too bad when most of them are interesting.  If you are interested in International Politics, the influences on policy making then this is the class for you.  My only gripe is that the prof took forever to grade the quizes and midterm. But maybe that's because he has 100 students.  Take this course. Great prof, really knows his stuff.

Listen, you're probably an underclassmen if you are reading this and considering govty 005 because you have "always wanted to learn about international relations."  Save yourself the time, money and effort.  Read a freaking newspaper and take an upperlevel govt'y class. This is an intro class. And, especially you freshmen who haven't taken any classes and probably won't read this until you figure out it exists your freshmen winter (if you're lucky), intro classes are terrible.  Man up, you're smart, you can catch on... and take an upperlevel class and skip govty 005 if you can.  No one will ask you if you've taken it if you enroll in an upper level course.    If you're a minor or a major. Get it out of the way. It's okay, but honestly, a pretty chaffy course. I was disappointed at best. Press means well as a prof but you honestly DON"T NEED TO TAKE THIS CLASS.    Okay. That said, you don't really need to do the readings if you go to class... so if you're a slacker, that's kinda nice.   The way he sets up his course for the fall of '04  midterm, final, 5 pager at the end (a summary of concepts type paper) and 4 pop-reading quizes during the term (a total chaff)   He's a pretty baised and unfair grader.  Figure out exactly what he wants and give it to him.   Good luck

Professor Press is a great professor.  He managed to make the lectures interesting and engaging despite the large class size.  The readings followed the lectures perfectly and I leave the class feeling like I have learned a tremendous amount about International Politics.  Strongly recommended for anyone with any interest in government or current events and how the world works.

press is a really great lecturer, his handwriting sucks so sit in the front. it was as good as it could have been i think for a class of 100+ students. i decided to major after this class.  its also graded the standard way classes of this size usually are with like a B/B+ median so keep that in mind.

The course material was overall pretty good, although at times the reading could get a little dense. Don't expect too much discussion about current events. There is a little, but the material is mostly theoretical. The prof is an excellent lecturer, very knowledgeable but easy to approach. He really cares about students understanding the material. Overall a good class for majors or non-majors.

This course was a normal government intro course, providing students with a basic overview of international politics.  Professor Press gave great lectures and was fluent in the topic, but the readings were dry and did not inspire interest in the topic.  The quizzes were tough and designed to make sure that you had done the reading and actually paid attention to what the authors were saying.  The final paper was a fair assessment of everything that had been covered throughout the term.

This class was a great survey of International Politics. Press did a great job of narrowing the material enough to get through it and keep student interest. He's an amazing lecturer knowledgable, informed, funny and engaging. The only annoyance came from ignorant classmates who Press was too nice to interupt them as they blathered on. I recommend this class and this prof!
@

The course was great although the huge class size (100)tended to make the discussions more limited than what I would have preferred.  Press likes engaging students ... take the class with someone else if you don't like speaking up and being involved...

Very interesting lectures, incredibly dull reading.  I believe the course is always taught as a 10, so make sure that you're always in class because the readings are a turnoff if you don't go for the thorough lectures.  The course work is hard, but interesting.  If you're looking for a class to "coast" in, this isn't the class to take unless you're the expert on IR.  However, you will definitely have a high yield of knowledge for the work you put out.

There's a lot of reading to do in this class but it isn't too bad if you make sure to keep up with it.  As soon as you get behind, you're in trouble.  The class is pretty interesting and the articles assigned are pretty interesting also.  The class focuses mostly on theory and very little on current international relations events.

Professor Press is a great lecturer.  There are a lot of readings so be prepared for that and unless you wrote the readings don't be prepared to ace the first reading quizz.  They are insane I would do all of the readings and still maybe pull off 50% it's like he designs them to trick you.  Also the final isn't spectacular either, trying to fit your argument, and three others while still sounding intelligent isn't easy to fit into 5 pages.  The class is large and when he teaches it, it's very popular so don't go expecting lively discussions though he makes a great attempt to get everyone involved.  Really there are about 15 people who contribute regularly so try to be one of those but have something to say I feel he let's people go on too much and at times it's more like "see how much I know" not I have something important to contribute.  So the bottom line go to classes, they are fun and Press is very enthusiastic but watch out for the quizzes.

Int'l politics is one of those classes (if Professor Press is teaching) in which you really need a laptop.  I used a notebook for the first half of the term and I must've missed some important details because he talks really fast.  Also, you can't read his handwriting so you need to get it down as soon as he says it.  It's important to do all the readings b/c there are a few pop quizzes- but they're very reasonable if you've done the readings.  I liked this course because I had no idea what was going on in the world before this and it taught me so much about fundamental concepts/problems in the world that different countries face.  As an American citizen, you should be informed of these kinds of things.  The midterm was a little tough, but he definitely makes up for it with the final.

there is a ton of reading, and it's not always helpful to understanding what he talks about in lectures. he's very smart but not a very organized speaker, and understanding his lectures requires a lot of background knowledge about history, especially the cold war. we learned basic theories about international relations but i didn't find them particularly useful for understanding politics.
@
Richard Lebow
/course/1451
The readings were kind ofredundant and pretty long/boring sometimes, but the occasional articles about the cold war and iraq were really interesting. The lecture notes were put on blackboard and gave a good general idea and outline of what you should know (even though the notes aren't really updated). By far the best part of class were the lectures. Lebow is very knowledgeable and interesting he used to work for he CIA and always has some great stories to tell (often the stuff that you read in history books... except he was actually THERE and played an important role). He's very liberal and doesn't pretend to be neutral so he voices his opinion a lot (and he curses a lot so it's kind of refreshing) but he lets other opinions be heard to. He really wants you to think on your own. Definitely a professor I would like to have in a more discussion based class. The tests were great to take (he would blitz us the exam and we would have to blitz him back w/i a specific time frame) so i found it hard to really stress over them. Overall, GO TO LECTURES not just because he sometimes takes attendence, but also because they're the best part of the course.Lebow really makes you think. Overall, I really liked htis class even if Lebow was a bit disorganized he's just interesting to listen to, and you do learn some basic knowledge of the material.

Prof Ned Lebow is really difficult to deal with. He gives good lectures and he really knows his subject, but the problem is he is very well-aware taht he is highly knowledgeable. He's extremely cocky and does not have time for the "little people" aka the students who aren't doing the best in his class. Office hours are a joke. Even if no one else is waiting, he will rush you out of his office rudely.  If you rely on your prof a lot for outside help, this is NOT the course for you. Don't expect him to give you the time of day unless you are the star student.
@
Richard Lebow
/course/1451
The course content was very interesting and covered a very broad range of subjects. It felt like we covered one huge section of IR each week, and it would have been nice to spend longer on each topic, but it is an intro. Prof. Lebow is really enthusiastic and loves his topic, which is great. His lectures aren't too organized, but if you just listen it all makes a lot of sense, since he hits all major points multiple times in each lecture. Disorganized lectures usually drive me nuts, but his felt more like a narration, and weren't frustrating. He is very biased and opinionated, so just accept what he says with that in mind. Atleast he makes his bias blatantly clear, and allows dissenting voices to speak. I wasn't prepared for so many readings, some of which were dry and repetitive. In general, they were interesting supplements to the general ideas covered in class. I didn't keep up on the readings completely; so missed out on some interesting material and applications of the general ideas covered in lecture. However, the tests focus on the general ideas from lecture, and a solid understanding of those ideas and a few examples of the application of those ideas to countries is sufficient to do well on exams. Exams are very straightforward and seemed fair. Just answer the questions completely on a pretty basic level and you'll be fine. Overall it was a good course and I'm glad I took it. Lebow is really nice and enthusiastic and informed about the subject.

Professor Lebow's lectures were always entertaining and interesting. He's a great speaker, and has lots of stories from his days working with the CIA, etc. He's a Cold War expert, which was good because he has all the inside information (from interviews, etc.), but bad because the Cold War inevitably became a focus of the class. We did get through the basics, but a lot of the readings were repetitive or filled with unncessary details. While the exams were perfectly fair, he's a somewhat odd grader - the points he awards for answers are a bit arbitrary. (There were two exams and a "final paper" -- basically two one-hour short essay tests, and one two-hour long essay.) However, he was very nice about grading, allowing students a chance to discard the worse of their two exam grades (many students did very poorly on the first midterm) - however, this means our final grades are determined by two grades. Overall, I'd say this is an interesting class. Those interested in IR will definitely enjoy it. However, it was entirely lecture (discussions were very limited). There weren't any interactive projects, like the nation-simulation some other Govy 5 profs do, which would have made the class a bit more relevant. I would probably recommend to definitely take Govy 5 (major or not), but maybe with a different prof. However, Lebow would be amazing for an upper-level/more specific Govy class, because he has an incredible wealth of knowledge.

When the course says "No textbook required," thats because you're reading a book every week.  This course was a large amount of reading but was manageable if you can keep up with it.  Falling behind is not a very good choice, though generally the lectures were so good that the readings were at best a helpful supplement instead of an absolute requirement.  This course was more intense than an intro course would be expected to be, but it was interesting and had a thoroughly engaging prof. Just take notes on the readings as you go through, because you will not want to go back and re-read them to review.

Lebow is an interesting lecture and a nice guy, it very liberal and is actively trying to influence his students perspectives on politics (which can occasionally be annoying).

Lebow is a very knowledgeable and accessible professor. He does a fine job in this course of teaching the basics of international relations by covering most well known theories and topics within the discipline. His lectures can be a bit inconsistent. Sometimes he is brilliant and keeps the class's attention for the entire period. Other times, it seems as if his lectures never get off the ground, and that he is rambling on about something that is not present in the lecture notes nor in the readings.  The first midterm was essay based and very subjective. One could explain his or her way out by explaining the theory behind it. The final was 20 questions, multiple choice. It was extremely difficult, since it seemed to me, and to many others I spoke with, that most questions could have been justified by 2 out of the 4 possible given answers. That being said, the mean grade for the class was a 60/100.   A very intelligent prof, a pretty good class, and a killer final...

This class is absolutely amazing, and really undoes the myth that all intro Government classes are painful.  In fact, the two I've taken are among my favorite at Dartmouth.  Professor Lewbow teaches the material with a personal interest, but does to keep his own opinions out of the lecture, something that is always appriciated during Government classes.  The readings, however, were numerous and a bit on the difficult side.  Once, however, he began giving us ideas to look for in each reading instead of us just plowing through each one, they became much easier.

Lebow is a pretty good lecturer as far as the subject goes. He tends to talk about his personal life a lot, but these stories are sometimes very interesting. He is also very willing to answer questions although the class can be very big and intimidating. The grading system was very strange in this class. He gave a midterms and a final. The final was a 20 MC question test that was weighted for 60% of the grade and the class average was 60, which he curved but even so was not a very good indicator of how much work you put into the class.
@

This class was a pretty good overview of IR. Professor Lebow is a really engaging lecturer who knows his stuff. The material and lectures were always interesting, but the reading were boring and dry. Plus, he really didn't test over them, so just read the lectures, know them cold, and you will be fine. You don't really need to go to class, but the lectures are always good so some incentive to go.   The downside, he is a really hard grader and the midterm counts for 40% of your grade and the final 60%. His midterm was an essay test, which was fair, but graded harshly. The final, however, was awful, it was a multiple choice test and the class average was a 60%. He did decide to curve it/adjust grades though based on the poor performance.
@
Richard Lebow
/course/1451
I liked this class, but the entire grade was based on a midterm and the final...and he told us that if we did well on the final it would essentially be the entire grade... hence if you didn't get an A on the midterm (or even a B) your grade entirely depended on the final....  Point being--while I thought that the class was good and the lectures interesting, the prof seemed better suited for a smaller, upper-level class with more papers--not a take-all final.
@
Richard Lebow
/course/1451
prof. lebow made all the difference in the class -- there's a reason he's considered one of our most distinguished professors.  he KNOWS his stuff, and is able to relate the often dry political theories with interesting present-day examples. the readings he assigned were very advanced, and often quite dry. in fact, he says he expects you to do all the readings, but i did 1 of the assigned readings all term, and received an A- for my final grade. his exams reflect much more on what he talks about in class than what he assigns in the readings. so if you're going to do one thing, just make sure you go to class...as long as you do that, you'll do fine. it's also very satisfying to see all the other dorky kids in the class who worked a lot harder than i completely bomb the final. the final was tough, but not unreasonably so. the amount of work you put into this class will not be proportional with the grade you receive. if you're the bookworm type, you'll probably hate this class and feel that prof. lebow's grading is unjust. if you're at all aware of what he's really trying to teach you, and study accordingly, you'll love this class. remember, it's not how hard you study -- it's HOW you study. peace -

This class was very interesting and a good class to take.  The reason it was worthwhile was because of the good professor, Ned Lebow.  He is very knowledgable about the subject of IR and instills passion into all of his lectures.  He explains what is happening in the world in such an objective, clear way that the class is worth taking just for the current events part.  Furthermore, the understanding of IR in the past is also good, especially Lebow's expertise in the Cold War.  That being said, the way the class was graded was not so great.  The midterm wasn't too difficult and was a good assessment because it was two essays.  However, the final was a poorly written test with "trick questions" coming out of every corner.  I did not approve of 67% of my grade being based on 20 multiple choice questions.  Since most of the class did poorly, Lebow curved the final, and my final grade turned out fine.  However, I felt like I mastered the class, but due to strangely worded questions on the final, I didn't do as good as planned.  Lebow is one of the jewels in Dartmouth's crown, but you must work very hard and read a lot to do well in this class.  Overall, it is a class you must take.

Professor Lebow is a very effective public speaker.  He did a fantastic job of relaying the material in an interesting and digestible manner.  My only wishes are that he  a) could have spent more time talking about the (extensive) readings,  b) expressed a little more interest in the course (he canceled several days, adjourned most others very early, and left the country during final exams so was not available for questions),  c) been more fair about time constraints on the midterm, and a little more so as well about allotting grade percentages (the midterm = 40%, the final = 60%).  Otherwise, the course was great - he didn't require us to purchase any books, he made going to class desireable and fun, and he brought International Politics to an approachable level.

The course was taught without a textbook which made a lot of the concepts pretty abstract in the beginning. However, by the end everything was sort of tied together and began to make much more sense.  The lectures were usually pretty interesting.  My biggest complaint was that the readings were long and I often couldn't see how they related to the material we were learning in class.  Lebow also didn't really discuss most of the readings in class.

The thing about this class is that most people who take it really enjoy it. I would not say that is the case when Lebow teaches it. And this isn't just a personal problem with the prof. I got a B+ in the class and was mostly satisfied with it. However the professor made it really difficult and not interesting to go to class.  As for the other aspects of the class....  office hours Lebow NEVER EVER shows up for his office hours! and if you blitz him, he'll blitz you back a one-line response that doesn't seem to answer the question. and if he can't answer it one line, he'll blitz you back and tell you to ask again in class. Basically, outside of lectures, he's completely unavailable. And make sure you ask your question at the beginning of class, because after class he books it out of there.  readings not too many. a significant load, but it wasn't really a text or intro level articles. all were applied theories that you were trying to read when you had yet to learn the theories. Oh, and the one requirment for every reading before Lebow assigns it - if he didn't write it himself, it has to mention his name at LEAST once.  exams basically memorize his lectures, which he posts notes for on blackboard. then you're likely to get a B. if you are "IR" oriented, or he likes your writing style - an A-/A.

This course has no homework due and Lebow can draw maps of anywhere in the world with amazing detail...what more can you ask for?  He's also just a really cool guy in general, and gives some entertaining lectures on a topic that I find really interesting anyway.  He casually relates stories he had while he was an advisor to the CIA during the Carter Administration involving promiscuous Moscow eavesdropping ploys.  Because there's only a final and a midterm for grades, they are a little stressful, but managable.  Definitely worth taking.

This was a great course--until the final exam.  The midterm was a standard in-class essay format, and was a fair test of what you had learned through readings and lectures.  Unfortunately, Lebow thought that a 20 question, multiple choice, on-line final was a similarly fair test.  The convoluted, esoteric questions led to a class average of 60, and many grades being contested amongst the students in the class.  While Lebow is a brilliant man--great lecturer, teaches the material very well, make sure you aren't subjected to one of his zany test ideas if you take the course.

I think my main disappointment with this course was that it didn't quite live up to all that it was hyped up to be. I expected it to be one of the best courses I ahd taken here, and it turned out to be just average. Prof Lebow is a fascinating person with great knowledge in a number of domains, he is entertaining and interesting, and you'll learn all about his work in the CIA. Unfortunately, his personality harmed his teaching it seemed that he was coming to class as if it were a chill discussion, browsing around different subjects without any clear outline. As a result, I felt I got very little out of the lectures. I would have preferred a more structured course, perhaps with a powerpoint outline or something, so that I could learned in an organized way. To his credit, Prof Lebow made the class easier than any of his colleagues, from what I hear. Some of the reading was quite dry, but the exams didn't require them. In the end, the reading were more like a supplement for the interested rather than central course material. On the other hand, Prof Lebow posted great lecture notes which explained every concept clearly and really redeemed the weak lectures (which is why overall I gave him a good rating) If you just study the lecture notes, you will do really well on the exams. In the end, I would recommend taking this course, but with one of the more experienced teachers (Wolforth and Press both made guest lectures and are really good) Also, it is possible, and quite likely, that Prof Lebow will get way better at this course. After all this was the first time he taught here.

The course itself was very interesting and Dr. Lebow gave us lots of interesting stories (that often had nothing to do with the actual lecture).  However, for an introductory course, I would take goverment 5 from any professor other than Lebow.  His expectations are far higher than students in their first or second terms can achieve.

If you want to get a good grade, don't do any of the assigned reading and just read his lecture notes over and over and over and over again. Memorize them, and what he thinks and you'll do great. The readings were much more challenging than the simple concepts that he ended up quizzing us on, but you had to know those concepts cold and be able to state them exactly as he wanted you to. To learn, do the reading and go to the lectures, but again, neither affects your grade much. Great course overall, and you really learn IR from someone who appears to be one of its leading scholars.

He uploads all his lectures onto the course website, which you can read before hand. When you go to class, he does the same lecture adding examples that usually end in his ranting about one topic or the other. Although some, unlike me, enjoyed listening to him talk and found what he had to say interesting, we all agreed that it generally did little to help us understand the coursework. There is no textbook, just a collection of readings (40pages each, between 1 and 3 for each class period.) They are interesting, but sometimes they don't really help you understand the coursework. He tests on some of the material, but you never know what he will include from the readings. His grading is arbitrary, his exam questions are ambiguous. He is also very stingy with his curve in my opinion. He did give the option of writing a final paper...about 15-20 pages instead of taking the written final though, which might be beneficial for some. Since it was a large class, there were no required papers, only two tests, a midterm and final.

The class was intersting, but lectures were often scattered and reading would frequently go unaddressed. The grading, in the end, was based on one paper written at the end of the course and was hard to judge. Someone who decide to take this course with Prof. Lebow, in order to fully appreciate the class, should be intensely interested in IR, ready to read the materials in full and attend office hours to discuss them.

Professor Lebow is a great lecturer.  His lectures were interesting and helpful with regard to the course material.  The readings were sometimes difficult but were always applicable and interesting.  Professor Lebow wrote helpful lecture notes and posted them on Blackboard for student use.  Overall, Professor Lebow is great and the class is interesting.  It made me want to take more IR classes!

Although I've heard mixed reviews from my fellow students, I really enjoyed this course and the material involved. Professor Lebow is dynamic and interesting and I always found him to be approachable and eager to talk to students. He has strong political views, which happen to coincide with mine, so I found his references and stories quite funny and interesting--although I can see how someone with a very conservative viewpoint might not appreciate his partiality.   the outside readings were interesting but not essential to the concepts of the class. The class notes posted on the web were quite useful, however, and concisely expressed the basic concepts necessary to succeed on exams and/or papers.  Overall, I found this class to be interesting and helped me to develop a fuller appreciation of the mechanisms of international politics and their implications.

Look, the bottom line is that Lebow is an amazing lecturer, very funny and tremendously engagin.  He's willing to work with you outside of class and will teach you what you need to know.  I am not sure how well he writes / grades his exams, however.    My Experience with Lebow in Gov' 5 is probably not typical.  I received a 63 on the midterm after studying really hard and doing all the readings.  This was dissapointing, I felt like the exam didn't do a good job assessing my knowledge. So, when the option to write a 25 page paper instead of take the final was offered, I leapt for it.  Also, because so many people (30% or more of the class) had below C grades on the midterm, Lebow said that if you showed improvement the final would be 100% of the grade so an A on the final was an A in the class.  Since the paper topics were pretty unrelated (at least mine was) to the lectures remaining, and the lectures were all posted online in their entirety, the incentive to attend class was only his amazing stories  & personality.

Professor Lebow is the man, seriously. He is one of the leading lights in the IR field, and Dartmouth has garnered itself quite a good find.  If you're lazy, don't bother to come to class or do the readings, don't take this class. You will only benefit if you do the work.  He is a hard grader, but fair and his lectures are the BEST in the government department that I've ever experienced so far. Professor Lebow is, the man.  Great prof, great course.

An interesting class with a very charming and engaging professor.  Unfortunately he is also a very fickle grader.  His exams were short answer questions very pertanent to the information studied.  However, one could very easily get zero credit for a seemingly perfect answer whereas one's neighbor would answer in nearly identical terms and receive full credit.  It appeared as though one's grade depended on a rather treacherous probability.  The average for the first midterm was somewhere below a 50.  Besides the russian roulette you might play with your GPA (lebow made promises to count the better grade out of one's midterm and final which he didn't keep) one learns a good deal about lebow's thoughts on international theory (most of the reading is made up of articles he co-authored giving a brutally onesided view).  I'll emphasize the fact that he's engaging and fun to listen to, and despite his flaws, i'm glad i had a class with him but would never take another.

Prof. Lebow is a very interesting person and he's had many amazing experience that were fun to hear about.  However, as interesting as he was, I didn't feel like I learned much of anything in his class.  The lectures were very broad and he did not clearly define what he was trying to teach us.  Our midterm was 10 short answer questions and was worth 40% of our grade.  Out of about 130 people, 29 got above a 79, and he barely curved it.  The grading on that exam seemed fairly arbitrary as well.

Prof. Lebow sings quite a siren song -- he almost convinced this political theorist to abandon the study of justice and ethics for IR.  He is a fantastic public speaker and can hold his own on a range of subjects -- while retaining the humility to admit it when he is out of his league.  Lebow the man, in general, is quite personable and helpful, worth talking to outside of class.  His writing, from what I have seen of it, is equally engaging; there is some truth to the saying that clear writing is a consequence of clear thinking.  That students consistently filled the lecture hall four days a week is a testament to Lebow's skills as orator and teacher.  Judging from a lot of the readings assigned for the course, there are a lot of IR theorists out there who could stand to hire a writing tutor, or at least an editor.  Still, their work nicely accentuated the ideas presented in lecture, and gave the student a good idea of the debates in contemporary IR research.  What struck me personally was the shallow, repetitive, and unscientific nature of many of the articles (a common malaise in the social "sciences").  They examined isolated historical examples and extrapolated tremendous, unwieldly generalities from insufficient evidence -- not much different at times from op-eds, except they liberally apply jargon in order to disguise their trivial natures.  I longed for logic and order, and rarely found it.  Such flaws in IR theory may be the source of many a misguided or irrational foreign policy.  A further cautionary note if you are an inferior writer or thinker, beware Lebow's tests.  He has high standards, and is not afraid to provide mediocrities with well-deserved Fs.

Gov 5 has tons of really interesting subject matter, but the best part of this course was the prof.  Lebow has so much real world experience and so many stories to tell, and you can tell in his class.  One word of advice, he likes textbook style definitions on the tests, but doesn't really give them in his lectures.  Find a gov 5 text book from a previous prof and study the definitions from there and you're set.  Another piece of advice, do the reading. Long, but very interesting!
@

Lebow is very very interesting.  He comes at IR from a psychological perspective, which makes for an excellent and unique lecture.  However, Lebow's reading assignments are very unncessary; many of them touch on the outskirts of information given in class.  Moreover, the tests do not cover any of the readings.  Most of the reading were not understood by students in the class, and Lebow was not good at explaining them to students.  Lebow, also seems to ignore certain students in the class, and selectively pay attention to others.  He is almost rude to certain students, while pandering to others.  Visiting office hours was disappointing.  He did not seem to want to spend any time with me, and many other students in the class expressed similar experiences at his office hours.  His midterm was graded in a haphazard fashion.  The mean on the midterm was so low, that he offered to scrap the test and make the final 100% of the grade if performance on the final supercedes the midterm grade.  I do however think that taking a class with Lebow is worthwhile on the basis that he is so interesting.  Get ready however for a very opinionated prof, who is unlikely to want to pay personal attention to you.

While it is very apparent that Professor Lebow is well-versed in international relations, his lectures are poorly-organized.  They obscure, rather than clarify, the readings.  The guest lectures by Professor Press and Professor Wohlforth were the best of the term.  In addition, Professor Lebow's grading was very inconsistent.  The material was interesting, but I would recommend taking the course with another prof.

The class was good. I felt like I learned the material well, and was interested by all the material.  Lebow is a good prof. He is funny and has an amazing command of the information he teaches.  The problem is that 100% of the class grade is based on the final exam, and that is a lot of stress, not to mention, it is not the best measurement of grasp of information.

It was alright.   It's a very theory oriented class, described as an "unusual" approach by another dept. prof.  I did like it. lebow is somewhat detatched from the class.  He is obviously very brilliant, and his lectures were great (he does a very nice job of using a web site to make lectures, readings and relevant docs available); one fears he has too much on his plate. The class was huge.  lebow lectures two out of three classes; the third is usually a q&a class, with students asking the questions.  the questions are interesting when they pertain to either the readings or the lectures.  The questions are stupid and annoying when either the russina girl in the front row askes them or when they are about what was on Good Morning America. Lebow's assignments are a lot of reading.  he gives a midterm (this term, do to overall "disappointing grades" the midterm did not count for the year unless the student so desired) and a final (or a final essay).

Valentino's great and knows what he's talking about- super organized with clear lectures. demanding in terms of the midterm and what he looks for in your explanations, but it's alright if you know the key points from your notes and major reading details. expect some pop reading quizzes to keep you on your toes, but they're easy even if you just skim the day's readings. the nuclear simulation was long and on a Saturday but kind of fun. he gets pretty into it too.  stay on top of the reading if you want to do well! a good amount of it, but it's the basis of IR theory and helpful to know for future classes and for general knowledge abt. international institutions & politics. even though i didn't ace it, the class was totally worth taking- esp. with Valentino

Valentino is clearly very interested in the subject and gives enthusiastic lectures. He is well organized and is reasonable with the amount of readings. Readings are relevant to the syllabus, and powerpoints in each class show good examples.  2 midterms and a final paper were perfect. Do all the readings, pay attention in class, and this course will turn out to be a piece of cake. A week of Simulation makes it exciting and gives a break from lectures.  Take the class for Valentino. He is busy, but very willing to help, and even more interested in discussion.

Valentino is a fantastic prof. He gives lectures that are clearly very well thought-out and every minute of every class contributes to knowledge of the course. The readings were the same. The two exams and the paper were fair in terms of questions asked and grading. Class was demanding but not overly difficult if you attend class and do the readings. My only criticism of Valentino is that he can be a bit frosty at times.
@
Benjamin Valentino
/course/1451
This is the best intro course I've taken in my 3 years at Dartmouth.  I held off on taking it because I knew Valentino did a great job with it, and he met my expectations.  The exams involve a lot of memorization so be prepared to explain the concepts that you write down there.  Valentino succeeds at combining his lectures with powerpoint slides that are fun and relevant.    The readings aren't very long at all (~30 pages per class) and they dovetail very well, making them easier to remember.  He gives pop quizzes on the readings, but if you've done them, you'll know the answers because they've usually appeared something like 10+ times in the readings.  Valentino also does a simulation exercise (nuclear non-proliferation was ours) where students are grouped into different "countries" for negotiations on one Saturday.  Valentino gives you the week off from class to substitute for this.  This simulation, though it might not be perfect, definitely allows for active learning in an intro class, which is unusual.

Benjamin Valentino
/course/1451
The reviews by other students for this course in previous terms were pretty much accurate - I followed their advice and did well in the class. Basically, Valentino is very particular with the exams. There are only two in the course and you pretty much need to give the exact answer, the exact phrasing he's looking for to get full credit. My advice is to do all the readings, go to all the lectures, and take notes that accurately reflect what he said in class and then repeat whatever he said on the exams.   The simulation was time consuming, but not an extraordinary amount of work. You're not graded on it, and it doesn't affect your grade unless you completely do nothing or do something exceptional.  There's a final paper thats about a third of your grade, but its short (1500 words) and not too bad.  Basically, its a decent amount of work and you have to dedicate time to it, but its not overly difficult, and Valentino is fair.

This class is awesome!  The readings are very interesting and for the most part, a reasonable length.  The tests are fair (although one or two essays questions were somewhat bizarre), and the end of the term essay ties the class together very nicely.  Valentino runs a weapons proliferation simulation about 2/3 of the way through the term, which was definitely the highlight of the course.  Valentino definitely knows his stuff and is a great lecturer.  Ignore comments about the impersonal nature of the class, it was a lecture course with an enrollment of over 100 students.  People who raised their hands to ask questions were downright annoying--its not a discussion class, deal with it.  I went into the course expecting great things from Valentino, and while it took me a while to warm up to him and the course in general, I ended up loving it.  TAKE THIS COURSE AND TAKE IT WITH VALENTINO.

Valentino is a GREAT prof.  He gives effective and interesting lectures that present the information clearly and really help you learn the material.  He reviews the main concepts you've read about in your reading but elaborates on them and discusses current events and examples to make it more interesting.  He is very sharp and extremely organized.  There's a reasonable amount of reading, but not too much, and they're mostly articles (no textbook) so it's manageable.  They're interesting for the most part too.  His exams are easy, although you do have to have done the reading.  A great class - take it with Valentino if you can!

The biggest downside to Gov 5 is its size it is a large lecture class with little student input/participation. Nonetheless, Valentino does a decent job of making the subject not too painful and even interesting - enough so that most students went to most lectures (i suppose the threat of pop quizzes didn't hurt).  The two midterms consisted mostly of memorizing and regurgitating the central arguments of the lectures/texts. The first was fill in the blanks and short answer, the second just short answer. The fill in the blanks was ruff since Valentino only accepted the EXACT phrase he wanted.  The final paper required more original thought and harder - but not impossible. The question was very broad - making it easy to write something but hard to write a focused, detailed paper.  The highlight was the awesome simulation. If you need to take gov 5, take it w/Valentino

Like any intro class, it can be expected that intro to IR is taught in a 100-student course; what's unfortunate is that this course doesn't have discussion sections to go more in-depth and actually talk to Valentino.  Get ready for a lot of IR theory in the first half before going into other issues (terrorism, econ) in the second, when all the readings from the first part start to really make sense and become more useful.  Scripted lectures were decent/well-organized but sometimes sleep-inducing; dimmed lights and not-so-engaging powerpoints didn't help anyone stay awake.  Tests are straightforward and fair and basically require memorization if not understanding.  The week-long simulation project was fun though stressful; it was frustrating not to be graded on it when it took SO much time and effort, but you probably get what you put in.  Overall, interesting, doable, and worthwhile.

Valentino is a great lecturer and explains everything very straightforwardly.  Most of the assigned readings were very interesting and relevant to the course.  Valentino runs a nuclear proliferation scenario which taught me a lot about the stances of nations around the world and the problems they have to deal with in international relations.  The tests, however, were a different story.  Each question was very directed, and was best answered in about a page.  The problem was, Professor Valentino wanted you to write more than that.  Besides that small problem, the course was great.  I recommend it to majors and non-majors.

Government 5 encompasses a lot of topics IR core theories, terrorism, weapons proliferation, economics, internal war, the environment, the spread of democracy, etc.  Some of the readings, particularly most of the economics ones, are dry, but they're easily outweighed by a lot of interesting, thought-provoking ones.  The reading lengths and difficulties vary greatly, from 6 pages to 60, easy to thick, but the class in general is never too time-consuming.  Professor Valentino is very organized.  His scripted lectures are accompanied by PowerPoint presentations, and are always very informative and interesting; they focus on and expand particular parts of the readings with historical facts, pictures, graphs, etc.  A handful are entertaining (especially the nuclear proliferation one), but the strength of the majority is instead being interesting.  Alas, with a bit over 100 students, there's no discussion, and while Prof. Valentino might know many of our faces, he knows only a handful of our names.  While more of an interactive class setting may make the classes more fun, it cannot be done, but frankly is unnecessary to get the job done and teach the material.  Go to class.  You should, or your grade will suffer in several ways.  First, he gives pop quizzes throughout the term to encourage attendance and keeping up with the readings.  It rewards responsibility, since the more diligent students would do the readings and attend class anyway.  Quizzes are worth 5 points each 4 points for putting down the right (and usually ridiculously easy and obvious) answer, and 1 point for putting down your name.  So even if you skim the readings you'd probably get the answer right.  As for the tests, we had two midterms one in the middle of the term, and one at the very last possible day roughly 1-2 weeks before the last day of classes.  While extremely straightforward, Prof. Valentino likes short essay questions to be perfect to receive full credit; as he says, he's very stingy with the last 2-3 points on every such question.  Alas, when your test consists of five of them, a 90 isn't too hard to come by even when you feel you have the material down pat.  Tests allow some latitude, for he never asks you to answer every question; he follows the "every question but one" rule if there are two parts, you'll be allowed to skip one question from each part.  The final paper encompassed all the readings we did throughout the term, including the ones assigned after the last midterm.  The question was very broad and difficult to answer given the 1,500-word cap and that some parts were much easier to answer than others.  It's given during finals period, and in my opinion, harder than the midterms since due to its lack of direction and preparedness that I felt compared to the tests.  The Arms Control Simulation took place during the last third of the term, right before our second midterm.  This activity fully utilizes our large class size, as Prof. Valentino broke up our class into many countries USA, UK, France, Russia, China, NK, SK, Japan, India, Pakistan, Libya, and Israel.  When it came to nuclear nonproliferation, some countries were definitely able to play much bigger parts than others, as the US was bogged down with responsibilities, NK & Russia were big focal points, and Japan played a minor role.  Fortunately Prof. Valentino tries very hard to encourage deception amongst the students and between the countries to maximize their countries' profits and screw over others'.  While it's very easy to slack off, it's a lot of fun to be one of those evil people.  Although he's only taught the class at Dartmouth twice now, Professor Valentino knows what he's doing and sets off to accomplish his job well.  You are bound to learn many things about world affairs and their causes, and leave the course having been fascinated by many readings.  Add to that one of the less common distribs, and it's definitely a worthwhile course.

Valentino is the best professor (albeit, out of 6) that I have had so far. He really strives to show all the main points of view and his lectures are amazing. His examples are clear, concise, and often very creative. For example, on our nuclear proliferation lecture he started his PowerPoint presentation with a picture of a fishing boat. Later in the lecture he used this seemingly innocuous picture to demonstrate just how easy it is to transport WMDs a fishing boat. Why would North Korea trust its unreliable missiles to attack the U.S. with a nuke if it could just deliver the nuke on a relatively small fishing boat, since less than 2% of shipping cargo is inspected even superficially? It’s examples like these that serve as real eye-openers and show you just how complicated IR is.  	The simulation is also a really important and lots of fun. We got to play representative parties of 9 different nations in nuclear proliferation talks (Which Kofi Anan happened to hold in the granite New Hampshire at Dartmouth). Each country’s delegation tried to negotiate according its national interests (NOT JUST, “HEY, WHY CAN’T WE ALL JUST SHARE OUR NUKES AND HUG?”), so some countries (ejem, NPRK) were more manipulative and subversive while other (i.e., Japan, Britain) focused more on diplomacy. People took it really seriously, so even some spying took place. At the end, the results were surprising and taught a lot, because uncoordinated, unfocused negotiations often lead to manipulation, and the countries you least expected of questionable actions played the system like a slot machine. The rest you can find out for yourself. 	The tests were relatively straight forward. His tests usually include a mix of fill in the blank, i.e., name four out of the 5 main principles of realism (a sentence or incomplete phrase is fine) and short answers (10-12 sentences). The test questions cover a combination of lectures and readings, so you will definitely have to know both well. I suggest STUDY GROUPS, i.e., splitting up the readings so that each person will do a short review for their section. That way, you write a summary for your 50-90 pg section and then have 10-20 pages of summaries total to study and not 350 pages of reading to cover for the tests. Nonetheless, it is good to highlight and even write short notes in your readings, because the final paper is usually a topic that could cover any or all of the readings (you don’t have to do outside research for the paper, but its short 5 page length means you have to be very focused and concise, which, from this review, you can tell that I am not). TAKE THE COURSE!

I heard AMAZING things about Professor Valentino. I can't say I experienced them. His lectures are extremely organized but discourages questions during class. Valentino dims the lights for the whole lecture...in a 10 this was a bad move if you looked around half the class was asleep. I had never fallen asleep in a class before govy 5. I think that my falling a sleep might be attributed to the dimmed lights and his organized yet uninspiring lectures.   Valentino wasn't really availible after class. He said you had to schedule an appointment and that made me not want to go to office hours. Before this class I was planning on majoring in International Politics, and now I am not as sure...I won't let this one class decide that for me, but don't go into the class expecting anything more than a standard intro class.

Professor Valentino is without a doubt one of the best lecturers, as well as one of the most personable, reasonable, intellectual, and fair teachers at Dartmouth. You will get out of the class what you put into it. The material is fascinating; I only neglected the readings twice. Three tips Go to class. Keep on top of the readings and make an outline of them as you read them; the midterms are based solely on class lecture material and the readings. Study with a group (twice) for midterms; it's a lot to swallow, but it's mostly common sense (if you've attended class).   amazingly smart man. fantastic class.

Professor Valentino is a great guy, he comes very prepared for every class and always gives a great lecture that reaches a fitting conclusion right at the end of the class period - it's almost uncanny how well-timed his lectures are.  There's also a class handout that goes with each lecutre and a Powerpoint presentation, so it's easy to recall what was said.  I'd still take notes, though.  We had two tests (midterm and final) and a final paper in this class, so the graded work wasn't overbearing, but there is a lot of reading on a class-to-class basis.  Some of the reading is quite longwinded and other essays seem slightly irrelevant, but on the whole most of the readings are interesting and applicable.  The defining feature of this class is the simulation that is conducted the week before the final.  It's hard to explain, just know this - govy 5 will take over a very large chunk of your life for about a week, but it is completely worth it.  The simulation gives you an opportunity to understand how countries interact with one another, and it's really enlightening.  If you put a lot into it you'll get even more out of it.

Both the course and the professor were amazing.  It effectively laid the ground work for an intellectual critique of world affairs and Valentino did it very well.  Some professors will stumble through lectures - Valentino has his lectures planned out his outlines are really helpful, his powerpoint augments the lectures, and he always seemed to say just what he wanted to say in exactly 65 minutes.  Really, really amazing.  Not much else to say - if you're interested in international relations, interested in the US' role in the world, or taking it for the major, this is a great class that's worth taking (and also is not very difficult).

Professor Valentino is amazing; he is such a great professor! His lectures were very well organized and clear. I definitely felt like I had a good understanding of the concepts and ideas presented when the course was over.  The tests are not difficult if you study, attend class, and do the readings. It is a combination of multiple choice and short answer, most of which is drawn from class.  Professor Valentino also does this awesome simulation. Each student is assigned to specific country that they must represent during a two-day simulation of a UN conference. It is such a great, hands-on experience and, even though you are so tired from negogiations by end of the second day, it is well worth the experience. I highly recommned taking this class!

Take this class if you have the chance to, it's incredibly interesting. The only downside to the class is there's quite a lot of reading to do. But the readings are usually fun.  Valentino is the best prof I've had at Dartmouth, he is an incredibly effective and organized lecturer, he covers a lot during class but as long as you go to class often enough and take good notes, you will do well.

I really enjoyed this class. After 2 terms of *mehhh* gov't classes, it was good to have my major interest confirmed. I was in danger of dropping the IR major until I took this class. IR classes in general seem to be more interesting than other Govvie courses, imho. The simulation was good fun, and the rest of the course was educational.

This class was loads of fun and honestly, was not much work at all...I didn't really do much of the reading at all...I just went to class each day and got an A-...a couple of my friends didn't even go to class very often and got at least a C.  The end of the class is a simulation which does take up a bunch of your second to last week of the term but is really quite fun...The exams were super easy.  The only problem is that this class was monsterous...he did try to answer all questions posed by the class, but it was really quite an impersonal thing...good for sleeping, not so great for depth of learning.

Valentino is one of the best profs I had.  He loves his subject so much that you can't help but love to hear him talk about international relations.   There are one-question pop reading quizzes once in a while, but they don't count for much, and are easy if you skim.    The tests were easy if you go to class and study the night before.  They were very fair assessments of the material, and there was some extent of choice.    Also includes a great nuclear weapons proliferation crisis simulation that doesn't count for anything, but is really a lot of fun.    I reccommend this course as a great intro govy course and Valentino for any course he teaches!

Valentino is great. The class was enormous and in a large lecture hall in the morning, but even under those circumstances Valentino did a terrific job delivering interesting and relevant lectures on tons of problems facing the world today. The best part of the class was this Model-UN type simulation that happened at the end of the class which was in part administrated by some Ambassador from the clinton administration who had gone all over the world rallying reform for the NPT and another brilliant professor from Stanford. For us, it involved a lot of spying and fun, even though it took up a lot of time.  Take the class, and don't be discouraged by how difficult the readings are in the beginning, because they'll make more sense during lectures.
@
Benjamin Valentino

I thought that this was a great class. The professor makes the material very interesting, even when we are going over dry intro theory, because he gives great lectures with clear power point presentations. There is a lot of reading (it uses up most of your Green Print money), but if you keep up with it and take notes to read later, it makes the tests very easy. His tests are mostly fill in the blank and essay form, and he asks questions that are right off of the lecture outlines that he provides for you every class. Also, he  is always available for extra help- you should go and ask him questions if any thing is unclear during class!
@
Benjamin Valentino
/course/1451
an interesting class but your knowledge of the subject is IN NO WAY reflected by your grade on the test dont attempt to actually learn the material, because if you understand it and say it in your own words he'll mark off you have to memorize exactly the way he says it to get a good grade

I highly recommend this class with Professor Lind. Most students didn't like her as I professor, but I found her to be a great professor and very open to helping students who seek help. Go to office hours the first day! She will like you as a student and participate in class. Also, most of her exams are based solely on notes so NEVER miss a class. I didn't do most of the readings for the second exam and got a 39/40. She does give pop quizzes though, but they are very simple; just skim the readings, and you can get all the multiple choice questions right.

Decent class. I've head brooks, valentino, wohlforth, etc are better, but Lind is pretty nice.   Lind actually likes to give bad grades, mess up the first test and you're screwed even if you ace the next one.   Two tests, a paper, and 5% class participation, though - not bad.   Go to office hours!

the class itself wasn't bad and might have even been enjoyable if lind wasn't the prof. not only is she a boring lecturer, but she is also extremely rude to you if you try to talk to her about quizzes and exams. besides that, her grading is extremely arbitrary, and she likes to take points off even if an answer is correct.   avoid her if possible.

It's a good class and Lind is a decent prof. The reading can get tedious, but it really helps. It's almost no work just two midterms and a final paper. If you do the readings you should be fine in the class. Lind does grade hard though.

Prof. Lind is very straightforward, and this comes through in her lectures, which are powerpoint assisted and very well organized and planned. There is not a whole lot of discussion in class, but the material is interested and Lind does a pretty good job with interesting lecturing, so it is easy to pay attention.   The work was very manageable, and the two exams were easy to prepare for, with no surprises- if you know the material, the exams should not be hard for you. The final paper was really just an opportunity to bring together all the ideas of the class. I found it actually very enjoyable, only hard thing was to fit all the information into the six page limit.

The class is very manageable. The tests are very simple as long as you take good lecture notes and understand the basic concepts from the reading.   The lectures covered the material for that class's reading, so the reading wasn't always necessary. Unfortunately, there were pop quizzes on the reading.   The prof was very nice and receptive to students questions, but her lectures could be boring because they mirrored the reading. Her grading also seemed to be a little random.  All in all, the course is worth the time is you find the subject matter interesting.

This class is very interesting, the lectures are great, and only has two tests and a final paper. If you do the readings (about 30 pages every class) you should be fine.

The course is relatively easy, though on exams worth only 40 points, it was easy for your grade to drop to a B or C even knowing all of the material exceptionally well.  We spend one class learning HOW to write a paper, which is fairly boring a ridiculous, but it reflects her grading-- she expects you to write well, so be able to. Lectures were a little dry, but you got the material.  Readings aren't bad at all.
@
Jennifer Lind
/course/1451
The lectures were generally interesting.  The readings were also interesting, save a few. She seemed like she didn't want to be teaching lower level undergrads and acted accordingly.   Her tests were not difficult at all.  You basically needed to understand the main points and how to apply them (obviously).  She was not picky about small details but she did expect your writing to be precise and to the point.  She assigned one paper, the final, and expected you to write it in the style she wanted.  She did have a full lecture and a discussion group section geared toward teaching you how to write.  I did not find this at all helpful.  I only read about half of the assigned readings, and felt that my grade reflected that.  I did not understand the finer points of the subjects.  If you chose not to do the reading pay attention in class, she reviews the readings very well.  If you do read the readings, make sure you understand how they connect.   I was satisfied with the class and was very glad that I took it. I would recommend it for anyone.

gov 5 is really great, and lind is actually an interesting lecturer. Her grading is very fair, and she's big on writing, but she tells you what she wants in an x hour about how to write well so it's not a problem. It's a fairly easy class, just do the readings and come to class and you'll do fine
@
Jennifer Lind
/course/1451
The class was nothing special, just an intro level gov class. I've heard Valentino is better, Lind was just alright. She was kind of patronizing and gave ridiculously easy examples to explain easy concepts. The tests were easy, somehow I managed to get 100% on both midterms. It's that kind of class.   I learned things, which was good. But it was tedious, plus it was full of 10s, which never makes for a good class- too anxious.

This class was definitely difficult--covered a lot of theory in a short period of time, but at the same time, if you listen to her lectures and pay attention in class, you can get by with  reading the articles afterwards.  You definitely need to the read the articles for the final and midterm, and I thought the exams were pretty difficult as she has definite nitpicks about wording. Like fighting is not equitable to war.   This class was interesting, especially her section on memory, but you need to watch out for a lot of dense, theoretical stuff that will fly right over your head if you skip a class or zone out during her lectures.

People have had a lot of issues with Jennifer Lind, mostly about her being really mean and insulting to students who ask her questions about their grades and papers.  I never actually talked to her about that, but I can't say I liked her at all just because she was such a boring and uninspiring professor.  Her lectures and her slides were all over the grades, and she gives way too much reading.  The reading would not be a problem if they actually helped me understand the material better, but the readings were basically repetitions of one another and of concepts that Lind failed to explain properly in class.  Her lectures felt stilted and unnatural, and I have no idea how she handed out grades.  I had an A/A- average for all her exams and quizzes, but I ended up with a B, which means I would've had to failed the final (which was worth around 30% of our grade).  This did not happen to just me, but other people as well.  Avoid this professor at all costs.  She made me want to stop being a gov major.

For an intro course I was impressed with what I got out of Gov 5. There is a huge amount of course material that you have to get through in 10 weeks so obviously you don't go  as in depth in subjects as you might hope. But you do get a basic understanding for everything. Be careful, due to the large class size, class discussions rarely go anywhere and are never productive.
@
Jennifer Lind
/course/1451
Lind's Gov 5 is a very solid class.  Her lectures aren't incredible, but she does a very job explaining the material.  Class moves pretty slowly, but the material is interesting, so class can be enjoyable.  Plus, her exams are very clear and fair.  It's a pretty easy class, and I would definitely recommend taking it, even though I've heard there are better profs for gov 5, like Brooks.
@
Jennifer Lind
/course/1451
This course is exactly what an intro/survey course should be, and then some.  In ten weeks, we covered major theories and relevant issues in IR (terrorism, globalization, etc.), and while there is enough to say on any one of those subjects to occupy a whole term, I came away from the course with a very solid foundation in all of them.  The lectures are clear and correspond closely to the readings.  Professor Lind is an engaging speaker; she injects the otherwise very straightforward lectures with anecdotes and a sense of humor.  She's receptive to questions and encourages as much participation as such a large class could afford.   It's worth mentioning that Professor Lind replaces one of the lectures with a debate and devotes another to discussing how to write clearly.  And go to class; she gives pop quizzes on the readings.

I found the idea of the class very interesting but its delivery was too dry for me. But other people seemed to really love that class. I just thought the professor was a little too dry and didn't explore subjects with enough depth. She was really fair about tests and homework. In class she's really nice, but during office hours she is really cold.

I plan to be a government major here, so I thought I would take a gov intro my first term, and I don't regret it at all.  I was upset that I didn't get Brooks based on his great reviews, but Lind did not disappoint.  She clearly explained all of the main points in the class, and then reinforced them again and again until it was impossible for anyone not to understand them.  We covered a broad range of topics but she kept everything within the perspective of international politics, so I never thought anything we covered was superfluous.  There is a lot of reading usually for every class, and while some of it is unnecessary and never seen again in class or on tests, the majority added to my understanding of the topic at hand.  Many people complain about how we never went in depth on topics in class because of how much we had to cover, but if you do all the readings then you can learn the details that the lectures don't include.  Between the in-depth readings and Lind's clarifying and easy-to-follow lectures, I feel like I have a very solid foundation in international politics.  I can't imagine a more effective intro class on IR, and what it may have lacked in not having a world class prof, it made up in just teaching me the basics of IR.  Timing is everything, and if I would have taken gov 5 a few years from now I guarantee I would have hated it.  Its a big intro class with little discussion and fairly basic material, and even as a freshmen I was annoyed by certain other freshmen that always took up class time with innane questions or rambling answers that held things up.  But overall I think it was a great course to ease me into Dartmouth and the gov department, never giving me much stress but also teaching me valuable information.  For any incoming freshmen interested in gov I recommend this class, especially because intros are required for a gov major and you don't want to have to take them as an upperclassmen.

This class may have a lot of reading, but it is worth it. I have always like government classes, but this class enabled me to look at world issues in an entirely different light. In such a large class it is easy to get lost in the crowd, but if you speak a couple of times in class, Professor Lind will quickly learn your name. My advice sign up for office hour appointments early, they fill up fast.
@
Jennifer Lind
/course/1451
I found Professor Lind to be an effective, relatively engaging professor.  She prepared and presented helpful PowerPoint presentations, and she chose well the readings to assign (although she assigned many nonetheless!).  The largely end-of-class open discussions, however, were unproductive and often tangential.  I would certainly have preferred to take this course in a setting of half the actual class size (or even smaller).  Overall a solid intro course with a fair workload (mostly readings) and fair assignments (two midterm exams and a final paper for which no outside research was required).
@
Jennifer Lind
/course/1451
The class was fine.  It was sometimes boring, sometimes interesting.  The amount you put in is what you'll get out.  She said at the beginning of the course that it was supposed to be a sampler, and it was; we didn't really go into anything in depth.  Lind is effective and clear, but definitely not inspiring.    there were two tests and a final.  She's a pretty picky grader- just make sure you back up everything you say and don't forget any steps.

Very interesting class, take it even if you're not a major. Professor Lind is a bit weak compared to the government faculty at large, though that also makes the class easier.

/course/1451
This class is an interesting overview of IR, but Prof. Lind sort of ruins it. It might just be my point of view (sophomore major who needed a second intro class for the major reqs.) but this class seemed overly simplistic and coddling. Maybe that's good for freshmen, but Lind is totally uninspiring and doesn't know the material that well. Put it this way there's a reason she's teaching mostly Gov. 5.  Otherwise, the readings are pretty good, the work is easy, etc. Just remember that profs. make the classes.  If you can deal with a professor who reminds you more of a soccer mom than a international politics scholar, then go ahead and take this class.
@
Jennifer Lind
/course/1451
The lectures were fine, but the course was largely uninspiring. It did not drive the students to think deeply about the highly controversial subjects brought up in the class on international security. Rather, it forced us to relearn topics most of us had already known about except in different words, and then simply regurgitate it on the exam with our new vocabulary. Also, take the different section, because it is a smaller class (50 instead of 100). The professor tried to be accommodating, but there were far too many over-zealous first year students that wanted to hog the spotlight every class. It is annoying when you have a student discussing an unrelated subject with the professor when there are at least ten people waiting behind in line to ask something actually relevant to th class.

Everyone seems to want Brooks for this course, but Lind was an amazing professor for this course.  She did an excellent job making the subject interesting and the lectures engaging.  Her style seems perfect for this sort of course.  She very good at breaking down international politics in a way that makes it fun.  The homework was relatively easy and fun.  So don't worry about not getting Brooks, Lind is an amazing prof and I would suggest that people definitely take her classes.

@
Jennifer Lind
/course/1451
The class is well structured...you start off with general theories of international relations and then progress to major issues and theory application.  Lind picks relevant topics, but she's not the most animated lecturer I had to force myself to pay attention as the term went on.  She also struck me as being kind of full of herself.  You could also definitely tell which theories/opinions she agreed with, which was kind of annoying if you wanted to make your own opinions.  The readings are good to do...some of them are really interesting and others are really boring...but everything in them is covered in the lecture so they're not absolutely necessary. The tests aren't bad...they're basically on major points of the lectures.  It's a large lecture course, so she tries to enforce attendance with "regular" reading quizzes.  She only gave 2.  The best part of this class was watching the news or reading about an issue in international politics and being able to pick out theories and stuff from class that were being actively used.  It's definitely a good intro course.

International politics is very complex, and with just a ten week term, there is a lot of material to cover. So each day in class was about a new topic, with maybe two or three readings to go with it, and that was it. We could not go into depth in any of the subjects because, instead of just focusing on a few main parts of international politics, we just barely touched on a plethora of topics, some important, some very minor. Professor Lind was, to say the least, not my favorite teacher. She gave her lectures along with a powerpoint, which is helpful for note-taking. However, she certainly has favorites for students and will continue calling on them during class while ignoring the majority of the students. Also, she frequently made comments about her own life, whether it was about her children or her book she has coming out (major self-call); and what do those things have to do with THIS course? And lastly, while she seems warm and personable in class, she is cold during office hours. She does not want to get to know you personally she simply wants to answer your questions and then get you out of her office. The assignments for the class were only readings (however A LOT of readings), so as far as homework goes, the class was easy. And the median grades for the mid-terms were B+s. I would recommend the class for an "easy" class to take while taking maybe a lab or a lit course. But don't take it to be intellectually stimulated, because you won't be.

There is a LOT of material, & it's easy to let yourself fall behind b/c she rarely gives reading quizzes. But most are interesting, & Prof Lind covers the most important areas in her lectures. Though the powerpoint delivery can sometimes be tedious, she makes an effort to be entertaining.   Grades were based on 2 midterms and 1 final paper. It took a good amount of work to earn a high grade, but it was worth the effort.

Professor Stam is a great lecturer, and I was never bored in class. This is the first govt. class I've taken, and it has definitely sparked my interest and encouraged me to take more. Professor Stam is brilliant and really knows his stuff, but he is less concerned with grading and individual students. The midterm was difficult, but the final was much easier. This class required a 20 page term paper, which was a lot of work, but Professor Stam broke up the paper into parts which was particularly helpful for me since it was my first college term paper. There was a very large amount of reading as homework, but I know that many people did alright without doing it. You got out of this class what you put into it. I loved it.

stam is a dynamic lecturer and you will not fall asleep in his class, even if there are 80 students in it.  but, hes not that great of a prof--goes off on tangents like crazy, only makes it halfway through his powerpoints, half the time u dont know whats being taught, just that hes made lots of interesting points.  tests arent too hard but dont really cover the material

This was my first term at Dartmouth, and this was by far my favorite class. Stam is an amazing lecturer adn is very knowledgeable in the subject.  While the material is challenging, especially the 20 page research paper if you stay caught up you will be fine.  Definitely recommend the class

Professor Stam is very fun to listen too.  His lectures are entertaining and he is knowledgable about his subject matter.  My issue with Stam was his aversion to the "liberal arts/individual attention" part of the Dartmouth education.  He readily admits to hating grading.  Therefore I never got feedback on any of the 4 drafts of the research essay that was a huge chunk of our final grade.  Granted, govy 5 is a 75+ person lecture class, but a little feedback would have been nice.

Strong course.  One of the most engaging lecturers at Dartmouth.  Stam has a reputation for being brilliant, and he is.  He speaks off the cuff v. well.  He is substantive and will not BS you.  But there are other brilliant profs at Dartmouth besides Stam.  If you're the type who typically worries about what to read/when papers are due/what will be on tests, it's probably advisable to take a course with another prof.  Stam's not your only chance to experience a brilliant lecturer - there are plenty!  That said, I think you have to be pretty uptight for Stam's "unconventional" way of running class to dissuade you from taking an intro Govt class with him.  I consider myself pretty uptight - I like scheduling work far in advance, like to know what's on tests, etc.  But his tests and papers are not so arbitrary that you can't do well on them if you study enough.  Be honest with yourself.  If you don't think you can handle Stam after the first day of class-shopping, don't take the class, don't risk having an exceptionally frustrating term.  But if you can roll with whatever he dishes out (95% of Dartmouth, this is you), then the class is an enjoyable experience.  Stam is def. one of the most memorable profs at Dartmouth.

Prof Stam is a great lecturer - very funny & interesting.  Doesn't seem to care too much about individual students/how they do - definitely no hand-holding.

I felt that Stam was exceptionally overrated.  While he is clearly a gifted public speaker and very knowledgeable about the subject matter, his lectures were disjointed, poorly organized, and hard to follow.  The outside readings were insanely dense and boring and his tests were ridiculous.  He clearly doesn't care about intro classes like this and it shows; his attention seemed to be elsewhere a lot of the time.  The course itself tried to cover a lot because it was an intro class, but in the end it had too much breadth.  If you have to take it, try it with a different prof; you'll get more out of it.

Humorous, quick witted, and opinionated--what makes Stam an incredible lecturer.  He made class a pleasure.  As long as you can keep up with the research paper and feel comfortable with some subjective-style midterm questions, you'll do fine.  He doesn't really care about grading/students, but that's not a big problem.    It felt like a hearty, all-American, fun for the whole student body college course.  Just take it.

Professor Stam is quite possibly the best lecturer I have ever had here at Dartmouth. His lectures are engaging and, quite frankly, inspiring.  This was a GREAT course to take during sophomore summer.  I felt that the course was paced just fine and that there wasn't a tremendous amount of work.  That said, don't take this course if you plan on being obsessive over your grade.  While Stam is a great lecturer and professor in class, his grading policy is sketchy at best.  The 20-page paper is not difficult and is done in pieces over the course of the term; however, it's questionable whether or not Stam even reads that paper, which is a bit disheartening.  He states at the beginning of the course that the median grade will be a B+.

Stam is a great lecturer. He's very engaging and I enjoyed the course.  That said, the organization of this course is horrendous.  There is no clear organization.  He strays from the Syllabus without mentioning it.  He assigns readings that we never discussed.  You have to write this 20 page paper that he doesn't even to at or provide comments to you for.  It's most frustrating.  The quizzes are fine.  The final is 40-50 MC questions, which leaves a lot of pressure on just a few questions since I'm not entirely positive he even borthered to grade the weekly quizzes.  Overall I learned a lot, but I wouldn't been much happier knowing how I was doing in the course.

stam is quite possibly the most interesting prof at dartmouth. he is unbelievably sarcastic and funny which made class lots of fun. as a non-govy person he inspired me to keep taking ir classes because he made the material really exciting. there was a lot of reading, but the paper was fair and so was the final. totally sweet!

The course is great, Prof. Stam is great if you can put up with his insensitivities (he's hilarious though), and the work keeps coming.  My only concern is that he doesn't hand back our papers or give us feedback on them if we don't go to office hours... and because of scheduling, I haven't been able to go.   Other than that, I love this class.  It's fun, intriguing, and the knowledge is useful.
@

Stam is a very effective lecturer and his expertise in the field is very apparent.    But as a professor of an intro course, he explicitly states that he does not like teaching and only does it to make money to write books.   Dont expect to get any feedback from this professor in this course. He is very difficult to meet with during office hours, and if you manage to catch him you get no more than 2-3 minutes.  He provides no written comments on tests, essays, or papers. Absolutely none. (what the heck are we paying for??)  Despite this, the material is very interesting and Stam structures the course in a challenging/engaging manner.
@

Professor Stam is a very entertaining prof, and there is rarely a dull moment during his lectures.  However, his lectures aren't terribly full of substance and are occasionally repetitive from one class to the next.  Also, students have no idea how they are doing in his class until they receive their final grades.  Nevertheless, I still recommend taking a class with Stam since he is a lively prof who inspires many of his students.

I have to say that my intentions of being a govy major wavered a bit after taking this class. Stam's lectures were unorganized and he liked to talk about himself and his accomplishments way too much, resulting in only a little bit of time left to talk about the material that we actually needed to cover. We had way too much reading to do and never went over those in class. There was also a 20 page term paper that we had to work on throughout the term and he blatantly told us that he was going to spend approximately 5 min glancing over each one. The exams were ridiculous though he did curve a lot.
@
Allan C.
/course/1451
OK, I'm going to be fair and start this on a good note  Stam is a very entertaining lecturer.  Bad things about the class  Everything else  The exams were absolutely impossible.  The median grade was absurdly low.  And despite the substantial curve, you left the exam feeling stupid because you couldn't answer half of it.  The pop quizzes weren't as hard.  The readings were so tedious and impossible to wade through.  And there was so much of it you could barely stay afloat.  The paper used a formula to predict the outcome for a conflict of your choosing.  Aside from the fact that I thought the whole concept was ridiculous, the paper is very long and you get virtually no feedback.  Twice I blitzed Prof. Stam asking him questions about the assignment, and he didn't answer either blitz.  He doesn't care about the class and it shows, and I expected more from Dartmouth professors.  In fact, this has been my only experience of that nature.  I apologize for the rant, but seriously, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!  Wait for a different prof or take Govy 3 or ANYTHING ELSE but this class with this prof.

I really enjoyed this class and i was surprised that I did. Professor Coggins is a great lecturer and I felt like I really learned alot about international relations and the world.   The readings for homework are kinda a pain to read every night, but it is very helpful to do them because it really clarifies the material she is talking about in class.  The pop quizzes aren't that fun, i think i failed almost all of them, but I still like I am getting a B in the class... pretty much just pay attention to the current events she talks about in class and you'll be good.  The tests are hit and miss... if your write what she wants in the free response you are good, but if you dont ( like i did on the first mid term...) you wont do so well. The multiple choice suck ... FOUR POINTS EACH!!!!  one thing that is kinda cool about this class though is that is  a big lecture course but she gets participation points into your grade by doing fun little activities on fridays.

this class was fairly boring. it wasn't that it was a bad IR class, but it was a large class and she catered to that.  the quizes were graded a bit to strictly and with such a large class she should have still gotten us grades back quicker.
@

/course/1451
This class was my favorite of the term. The class had pretty interesting readings, but some of them were hard to understand. Prof. Coggins tries to give interesting lectures, but falls flat at times. During class she is willing to explain readings, but at the exam reviews she is more evasive in her answers, telling you to re-read the readings. You definitely have to pay attention in class, because her slides are mostly pictures and don't have any details on them.

Althought this class was interesting and relatively easy, I was a little disappointed. The readings never seemed clear, the midterm grades very random and the pace a little slow. Prof Coggins is incredibly nice, though, so if you want an easy intro class with a funny prof - take this one!

Was fairly interesting, and the readings weren't too bad, but the exams were not representative of the lectures, and they were fairly difficult. The final paper was also insane. Coggins was pretty decent.

I think the material Coggins chose was a great overview of Int'l politics, but her lectures can be a bit boring.  If you do the reading and go over the powerpoints, you'll get a great understanding for international politics -- the lectures don't always help unless you need something explained.  She's a really nice person, really intelligent and knows what she's talking about though, so visit office hours.
@

The readings for the course were very long sometimes, and also very confusing. They ended up causing more confusion than less most times, and although the lectures clarified them a little, it was not perfect. Also, the Professor refused to review some reading topics at a review session she held, thus making almost everyone's questions go unanswered. The lecture slides lack content, but her lectures are interesting - especially in the second half of the course.
@
Bridget Coggins
/course/1451
This class was very intersting and Prof Coggins does a good job explaining the material and all of our readings very clearly. she did not assign reading just to assign it...we went over everything that she asked us to read...this was helpful since a lot of it involved IR theory. Her tests are very fair and were really easy. We had two midterms....one after 5 weeks and anohter 2 weeks later (so very little material to learn for that one). There was no final, just a 4 page paper on a book we had to read...this made the end of the course very easy and enjoyable. I would def recommend this class as an easy 3rd that is intersting with a good prof!
@
Bridget Coggins
/course/1451
We were graded on 4 pop quizzes (best out of 5), 2 midterms and a 4 page final paper, all of which were pretty straightforward. The class was generally lecture-based, although we did have some small group work once in a while. Professor Coggins is young and enthusiastic, which makes her lectures dynamic and interesting! Take it with her if you can!
@
Bridget Coggins
/course/1451
coggins is young, nice, and tries really hard, but i think she's better at teaching smaller classes - lectures were very slow and painful. take gov 5 with a prof with a more dynamic reputation.  i took gov 5 as my third class because i've always heard good things - the subject of the course itself is interesting, but it's mostly theory, so class was mostly about theory too. we talked about current world events occasionally, but hardly ever applied what we were learning to analyze them.  coggins' grading style is fairly picky and arbitrary at times.
@
Bridget Coggins
/course/1451
from the first day of the course, coggins described and taught this course not as international POLITICS but as international RELATIONS which are not the same thing. rather than what the ORC described, we thought about the theoretical paradigms of the discipline of IR. it was alright, but i think i would have preferred politics.
@
Bridget Coggins
/course/1451
Introduction courses are never that great... sure there is the bonus of anonymity provided by having 80 peers in a lecture hall, but Professor Coggins managed to make the course interesting and inspiring.  Her goofy personality was just enough to keep me attentive, and her lectures were well organized, and while she gave her lectures she made sure to speak at a speed conducive to taking notes.  Tests were a breeze, two midterms and no final (just a 4 page paper).  There was hardly any reading for a govy class (just ~10pgs/night).  Watch out for the quizzes, but they aren't took bad if you keep an ear our for current events.  Overall, a great class, with a fantastic professor who's very interested in her subject material and who you can tell is thrilled to have to opportunity to share her vast knowledge.  Worth taking even if you don't know the first thing about realism or where Moldova is.

I enjoyed myself in gov 5. Coggins is a young and friendly prof, and gives fairly good lectures. The assignments/quizzes/exams are well spaced out, and you don't have to freak out if you mess up one of them. Coggins is a fairly generous grader/question-setter, and the first midterm in particular was a breeze. The final assignment is a book review of any three books on globalization selected by Coggins, and I am somewhat embarrassed to say I did the whole reading and mashed my paper out in the final 24 hours before it was due (in my defense I had a crazy final/term paper schedule), but I did fairly okay in the course nonetheless. I did have some trouble going to Coggins's office hours, but that was mainly because I had an odd schedule this term - she has pretty good ones, and is willing to meet with students at other times.  A word of warning about the lectures Coggins puts up her slides on Blackboard, but they do not have much information on them. While I agree with her philosophy, I think this and her teaching style did make it hard sometimes to identify what was important in the lectures. Sometimes I was confused about whether she was just taking an incidental digression, or actually making an important point. The readings are reasonable, not too large and not too technical. They are critical, though, so you can't really skip them (I did that a couple of times, to my regret). These caveats aside, I think Coggins is a perfectly fine prof to take gov 5 with.

Coggins seems nice enough, but lectures were generally pretty bland and so was the material. The class and the whole atmosphere was pretty dull and uninteresting, but if you're really interested in the theories of international relations rather than real-life situations, (and a Gov major, you'll have to) take this class.
@
Bridget Coggins
/course/1451
Class focused more on international theory rather than current international relations. Lots of reading, but you don't have to spend hours on it as long as you have the main idea. Exams were really easy. The book/final paper at the end was kind of annoying, but manageable. Pretty good class if you're looking for a distrib.

I think the professor did a decent job with a lousy course.  I have a high level of interest in IR, but this course just wasn't very interesting.  It's basically about the theories of international relations, which tend to be dry and at times pointless.  The interesting parts of the class were whenever we would go over current events in the world (never for very long) and when General Abizaid, former CENTCOM commander, spoke to our class.  She basically goes over the readings in class, so you can skim or just not read them most of the time.  For the tests, know the theories like the back of your hand and  so that you can apply them and you'll be fine.

This class was really good and interesting! I really liked all the material (except the econ portion). Readings are a lot but if you keep up with them and take notes, it will pay off. Also, do the readings before class! It makes the lectures easier to follow. The tests are based on the reading so you have to do the reading. there are 2 test and a final paper which is nice. Also, he has a simulation where you will be put on a delegation team of a country and you have to try and solve a real-world IP crisis. For my term, a former UN ambassador was brought in and it was really interesting. Really interesting class and would recommend!

Lectures can sometimes get a little dry (I was esp not a fan of the month of theory we did first). Beware of the first midterm - it was my freshman fall and I didn't know any better, but when Wohlforth says he's asking short answers about the reading, that's what he's doing. Make sure you've memorized the concepts and authors thoroughly. He's a more lenient grader with the essay midterm and the final paper. Overall does a good job exposing you to a bunch of different fields in IR.

Govt 5 is the quintessential Ivy League course distinguished professor, cutthroat students, and tons of work.  Prof. Wohlforth is the man - 'nuff said.   He invited a British ambassador to the UN to oversee our crisis simulation. After a few days of intense deliberation, he made us present our position. I can't stress how hardcore some people made it. Secret blitzes, false information, the works.   The exams require your full attention. Prepare to regurgitate facts. He may choose one topic out of twenty. You never know what might be on the exam. The final was down to the point. People did well on it.   The essay of your choice made you think. Once you were done thinking, just write. Not a hard assignment.  To be honest, Govt 5 has been my favorite class so far. Prof. Wohlforth really deserves most of the credit.

Wohlforth was the best professor I've had yet. His lectures are great, he keeps the reading to the important points, and after his class I might switch to government as a major. The one negative point He grades very hard. Be prepared to study a lot for the exams and know everything inside-out.

You cannot go wrong with any of the international relations professors in the Government Department.  They are all top-quality scholars who care about their students.  One hundred people take GOVT 5 per term and for good reason the class provides some essential concepts and theories for understanding world politics.  Some of the textbook reading is dry, but the articles and lectures are interesting and thought provoking.  The two midterms were challenging and graded somewhat harshly, but I was satisfied with them on the whole.  The paper gives you an opportunity to express clear and concise arguments about international politics.  Wohlforth is an engaging professor who welcomes questions and always considers the perspective and opinions of others who may not think like him.  No reason not to take this class.
@

This course inspired me to become a government major.  Although this was Professor Wohlforth's first time teaching International Politics, he did an admirable job.  His lectures were very effective and really helped hammer home the points made in the readings done before class.  Professor Wohlforth's philosophy is that readings are important, but excessive amounts only detract from the quality of the student's education.  That said, none of the readings seemed extraneous, and they were almost always very interesting.  My only complaint is that the class did not provide an effective forum for discussion.
@

After hearing some horror stories about Govy 5, I was hesitant to take it. But Prof Wohlforth turned out to be an amazing teacher. He knows a ton about International Relations, and was genuinely excited to have the opportunity to teach an introductory survey course on the subject. His lectures were well structured. The reading was extensive, and sometimes a huge burden. There were a couple of reading quizzes that were a minor annoyance. The exams were pretty straightforward, though I thought that the first exam was difficult, in that we were supposed to remember what each individual article was about, and we had read more than twenty.  Other than that, this class was really interesting, and it makes you look forward to taking upper-level International Relations courses.

Everyone always told me what a great course govy 5 was, and after taking it, i certainly agree. yet wohlforth seemed to take a little away from my enjoyable experience. while he is extremely organized and prepared, he was very coinceited. when i asked him what was wrong with an answer on my test he said "do the readings and then you will know". he also does not give enough time to complete tests, limiting them to 50 minutes instead of the whole class period.

This course was pretty good for an intro...it was interesting and gave a really good background on the subject.  I feel like I came away with a good basic understaning of International Relations.  Wohlforth is a really good lecturer, very organized and easy to take notes.  Some of the readings were tough, but nothing too bad, and Wohlforth really did a good job on assigning only the reading that was necessary, I didn't feel like there was anything irrelevant or repetitive.  The exams weren't easy, but they were a fair test of the material.  Overall, I would recommend this course to anyone, even if govy isn't your major, it provides a good understanding of material that is relevant to everyone.

This class is basically what you'd expect from an intro gov course.... but I just don't like Professor Walker. He's too smart for us - like, he doesn't think the same way the rest of us do. The comments he wrote on my papers and exams seemed ridiculous, not because I couldn't understand what he was saying, but because I couldn't understand WHY he was saying it. Going to his office hours didn't help.  Some people in this class loved it, and loved Walker, but I'm not one of them.  I will say that I liked the format of the exams (for the midterm and final), but other than that I really didn't agree with the way this class was taught.
@
Thomas C.
/course/1451
This is a good class to take if you want an overview of Int'l Politics. Don't expect to get too much in-depth study of any individual cases. There's a lot of theory and overall pattern study. It doesn't relate much to current events, but the patterns and theories you study will help you gain new perspectives on current events if you do some thinking.  About the work Read the "questions to consider" on the syllabus because they're mainly what's important, but be aware that doing the readings will help you in class. There are only six reading quizzes per term and only four of them count (he grades pass-fail and if you get four right then you get 100% on RQs).  Start the papers ahead of time and go to office hours.  Mainly, this course is fine if you keep up with the readings and concepts. Try and wrangle the study guide for the midterm and final from Prof Walker ahead of time.  Mostly, GO TO OFFICE HOURS because Prof Walker has some interesting perspectives. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Office hours may not end up being about the assignments persay but the prof's got some intriguing things to say about his subject.  STUDY AHEAD OF TIME. Honestly, that's the basic one thing to do in this course. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO CRAM AT THE LAST MINUTE and you'll be absolutely fine. Cramming might work partially but you'll end up working so, so much harder than you could have. Just study in advance!  Prof Walker is good but he expects a lot of us, especially as first-term freshmen.  The class size was supposed to be 25 but ended up at 55.  Participate, pay attention, and study. You can get by on some of the readings but you'll regret skimming later on.
@

/course/1451
Professor Walker is just visiting, so the opportunity to take a course with him is likely quite limited.  If you have any interest in gaining an international perspective of politics, society, and history, though, try as best you can to get this course with him!  He is friendly and helpful to those who approach him- but you have to make a sincere effort.  (Don't think that you'll get by with skipping class, though.  He doesn't keep attendance, but he's very good with names and faces, contrary to what he says, and if you're not frequently in the class's ranks it will sour his opinion of you.)  There are a lot of readings, but often you can do well in discussion/lecture and on the occasional reading quizzes by just skimming the lengthier ones.  A very rewarding course and enjoyable prof.

This was my first government class at Dartmouth, although I was thinking about being a Gov major this class made me POSITIVE. Walker teaches at a pace which is just right a mixture of lecture and discussion. He lets students give input but makes sure to cover all the material assigned. His exam format is perfect because it is a very fair evaluation if you 1.study and 2. go to class you will do well. also, he gives very good lectures and real life examples of theories that might otherwise be boring       Overall he makes the topics interesting, covers exactly whats in the reading and if you do the reading and listen in class you will be fine. Defintely recommen GOV 005 especially if it is with Walker.

Going into this class, I knew absolutely nothing about International Politics but took it anyways because I thought I would be interested in it. The structure of the course is the first few weeks are mainly theory, with sometimes dense and difficult readings. But after that it becomes more specific into how these theories apply to other aspects within the international system level. I highly recommend the class with Professor Powers because she is just so passionate about the material and the course. She is very open to meet with you outside of class, open to new / dissenting ideas, and just a great professor overall. As long as you do the readings and really understand each sides of theory and what the authors are discussing, you'll be fine. There are two midterms and a final paper. The midterms aren't bad as long as you pay attention and take good notes in class, and do all the readings. I highly recommend Professor Powers to anyone interested in taking this course.

/course/1451
This class was a really good intro to international relations and systems!! We started with theory for the first few weeks and then moved into applications, like the Iraq War, the Rwandan Genocide, apartheid, global environmental policy, and a bunch of other things. Prof. Powers also showed us a diagram of the class structure at the beginning of the class and checked in with it whenever we moved onto a new section. The class was really well organized and there were plenty of moments to discuss the topic in small groups, and Canvas posts were made available if you preferred not to contribute in class or if you had something longer to say. The midterms were straightforward and Powers sent us memos before each midterm spelling out what she wanted from us. She also passed around candy during the midterms which was really cute! The final was a 5 page paper double-spaced, so you need to be more concise than your average English argumentative paper. I regret not being able to go to office hours but I still felt like Powers was super approachable and kind, so definitely take this class with her!

This class covered some really important stuff and definitely gave me a much clearer view of the inner workings of international politics.  The first paper and the midterm were just right in terms of difficulty, depth, etc.  but the choices for the final paper were much more in-depth and complex than you should usually find in an intro course.  One big plus is that Professor Steele was extremely helpful and responsive to student concerns.

I really enjoyed this class.  Babik would write out his entire lecture in bullet points on the board before beginning, so the material was very easy to follow.  He does give reading quizzes at random during the term, so stay on top of the reading...it helps to split it up with people and focus on the big points since there can be a lot of reading to do.  The exams and papers weren't too difficult but do require a lot of preparation.  If you like gov you will enjoy the class...if you don't, you might want to try a different prof.

I had heard this course was awesome with Bentz and the lines to get in were long.  I really wish I hadn't gotten in for the sole reason that this course really had no value to me as a non-major.    Bentz said on the first day not to take this course if you weren't going any further in Econ, and take 2 instead.  I can't speak for two but this was not interesting to me from a math/science perspective and I wasn't so psyched overall.  The median grade on all the tests was something like a B, which seemed rediculous, and all of his exams were designed to trick you, and didn't have a curve.      Bentz comes highly recommended but I'm not sure quite why, other than the fact that he's slightly wierd and I guess a little funny.  If you need this course, take it with him, if not, don't take it at all if you think you might be interested.

Bentz is awesome and gives excellent lectures. I wouldn't miss class because that is when you learn most of the material. Also the first mid-term was fairly easy and the second one sucked...study for the second one. The final wasn't bad either. If you are a major, definately take this class because Bentz makes this stuff interesting. If you are not required to take this class, be prepared to put work into it.

Bentz is average - not that exciting.  His lectures consist of powerpoints and it's very easy to become distracted and bored.  Bentz admits that he thinks the material from the first half of the term is boring and it shows.  Additionally, if you're an A-/A/B+ student you get screwed.  Everyone who's a B and below student gets their grade bumped up while someone with a 94 average gets an A- instead of an A. His tests are hard but fair.  I've heard Bentz is better than the other prof but he's nothing special.

The reality is that the material in econ 1 just isn't that interesting.  Most of the material is very idealized and inappicable to the real world and the course is so big that the professor has to go very slowly sometimes.  But if you have to take Econ 1, make sure you get Bentz.  He is a great prof who really cares and  tries very hard to make econ interesting and to help everyone understand.  Though the first two tests can be tough, the final is a piece of cake and does a nice job of boosting grades at the end,

In order to do well on tests, you actually need to LEARN the material.  If you only kinda get stuff, you'll probably do just kinda well.  Doing practice problems is key, as is practicing drawing all of the different diagrams.  Basically, it's hard but worth it.  Bentz is one of the best profs I've had here--actually seems to like teaching, pretty quirky, very into PowerPoint.  Laughter in class was more normal than not.  Good times; I recommend it if you're not afraid to work and learn.

It is true that Bentz is a very good prof.  He obviously cares about teaching immensely, as he puts a great deal of time into his (very helpful) powerpoint slides, and explains things quite thoroughly in class.  He runs a very useful website on blackboard, and is accessible outside of class via blitz.  The textbook is *very helpful* in clearing up anything that remains confusing.  The one setback to the class is that the tests are EXTREMELY tricky and dont always seem to focus on the same subjects stressed during lectures.  The median grades on the two midterms were a 79 and a 73, and the final was somewhere in the lower 80's, and there is virtually no curve.  That being said, Bentz's final B/B+ range is very generous.  If you plan on taking Econ 1, Bentz is your man

I enjoyed this class very much, but wasted money on the book, I only used it to look up a word once. You don't need it, everything on the exams is covered in Benz's lectures and powerpoint. He posts all his lectures on blackboard and hands out a packet of all his slides for the term at the beginning of the class. He also posts previous exams and their answers so you get an idea as to the type of questions to expect on the exams. There are two midterms, one final, none of them being curved, but he helps you learn the material enough where you don't need a curve, just work problems from previous exams. There are occasional online workouts too. Benz is a great prof, who's great at answering any questions, he responds rather quickly to blitzes. This class made me lean more toward econ as a possible major and i'm taking another econ course next term because of it.
@
Andreas Bentz
/course/859
Econ 1 is a necessary part of the Economics department, because it isn't curved and a lot of people flunk out and have to drop it.  The test questions are tricky enough that you'll make enough careless errors to drop into the B range, so an A is ridiculously hard.  Too many people want to take Economics.  ONLY take this class if you think like an economist, and are dedicated to the field.  If your parents are forcing you to be an Econ major, you'll drop this course.  Bentz is an incredible professor, one of the smartest and most entertaining I've met.  He is the ideal Dartmouth professor in every respect, and he inspires interest for the field.  If you have to take Econ 1, take Econ 1 with Bentz.  That said, the course appeals to the lowest common denominator.  If you understand this stuff intuitively, you never have to attend class (unless you really like Bentz).  If you pick it up quickly, class can drag on forever, and often gets bogged down with stupid questions.  I felt like everything taught in the course could have been summed up in a day if you just sat down and talked to the prof one-on-one.  Basically, if you are serious about Econ, take 1 with Bentz.  If you're not serious about Econ, take Econ 2 or just stay away.  You will get torn apart.

Bentz teaches so clearly that the book became extraneous. The rumor I heard before the class was that Bentz is the best econ 1 teacher, but he is also the hardest. Honestly, some of his questions may be tricky, however, the grades ended up falling right in line with the other class. The most important difference is the level of understanding that Bentz will give you. Although the kids in the other econ class recieved the same grades, they didn't understand the material half as well. The bottom line is take Bentz. He is the best professor I have had so far at dartmouth. Econ is kind of a dry subject and Bentz does a great job at not only making your want to listen, but also helping you understand easily. Take Econ with Bentz

prof. bentz is adorable, he makes you love econ. but his tests then make you hate it and wonder why he is torturing you. first test is easy, second is HARD OMG yes, you dont expect it to be, you expect same level as the first test but noooo do NOT be fooled. it is MUCH harder, the final is like a mix between the two. don't take this class and expect an A unless you're an econ genius.  bentz teaches really really well, but his tests are tricky-he tells you this straight out they're designed to see how well you know the material, if we had just had more time, i think i could have scored higher on each test. his grades are fair though, but NO CURVE and im sure other teachers grade on a much easier scale.
@

He's the best professor that I've had yet at Dartmouth. He loves his subject and has good lectures. HOWEVER! The tests are very, very difficult if you're not in the same critical mindset that they're written in. They reminded me of being in the SAT's again. Questions on known material but twisted. So be sure to take the class seriously and to practice lots.

Econ 1's material that is taught by Bentz is preety easy. The key is to know the material. If you know the material better and spend a little extra time studying your grades on exams will increase heavily.
@

Professor Bentz helps makes a generally simplistic and boring subject more intesting. He gives good examples and at least tries to keep interest in the material. Econ 1 is a class for quantitative thinkers; if you don't like math don't take it.

Bentz is an amazing professor. He was extremely helpful whenever I had a problem. He usually answered blitzes within a few hours. His lectures were stimulating, and I think I learned a ton.

The material is interesting and the professor is a nice guy.  However, this is not a class for everyone.   I put alot of work into this class, but I still came out with a grade that makes it look like I never went to class.  The exams are hard---not in the content, but primarily in the time pressure.  There is also no shade of gray in the grading or completion of the exam--you have to know exactly what to do immediately upon looking at a problem.  For people like me who would rather write papers, this means that exams were often frustrating as I felt like I could never get out everything that I knew and understood, especially since I am horrid at drawing graphs.  In fact, this is my central issue with the class  DO THE PRACTICE TESTS UNTIL YOU ARE NUMB AND YOU CAN DO THE PROBLEMS IN YOUR SLEEP!!!! If you can't do the test in your sleep, then you don't the material according to Bentz's system and you won't do well.  So don't let yourself get frustrated and save your grade----DO THEM!!
@
Andreas Bentz
/course/859
I thought that the professor made a lot of the concepts more confusing then he had too.  It seemed like he wrote the test questions in such a way to purposely trip you up.  I'd rather have a professor who wanted me to know the material he taught, rather then try and trick me on a test.

Bentz is a really good prof. He explains things well and makes sure you understand everything. The only thing bad about this class is that his grading is unfair. Because of his wierd grading system, it is very easy to get a B, but harder than another class to get an A. Other than that, the class was great.
@

If you're going to take Econ 1, you really should take it with Bentz.  He's a great prof to learn from - interested in the material, gives effective lectures, is responsive to students, is happy to help at office hours.  He makes some good jokes too, especially by professor standards.  All in all he's the best prof I've had here at Dartmouth - granted, it's only my second term here, but it still says something about the quality of instruction.  If you read the other reviews as well I'm sure my opinion will be seconded.  The course itself is also interesting stuff, it convinced me that being an econ major is really what I want to do.  The course work isn't overbearing; you can keep up with the reading and do the weekly workouts without it taking a real hit on your amount of free time.    Having said all of that, Bentz is a master at making his exams tricky.  Not impossible, not overly challenging, just tricky.  This, combined with the grading system used in the class, makes it difficult to get an A (although not impossible) but very possible to get a B with some effort.  I found that the best way to review for tests was to try the practice exams posted on Blackboard.

Bentz is a great teacher for Econ 1. He not only knows the material really well (he helped write the book we used), but he's very good at explaining it and making sure that everyone understands it. The workouts help make you learn the material as you go along, and the exams are very fair and predictable, even if a little on the tough side. He basically tells you what to do to study though, and if you do that, they're not bad at all. The material was a little on the dry side at times, but overall I really enjoyed the class and would highly recommend Bentz as a prof.

Although the material was boring at times, Bentz is AMAZING and makes you inspired about even the mundane.  His lectures are incredibly effective and he explains the concepts in terms accessible to people without previous economic experience.  The exams are difficult, but manageable if you study hard and do lots of practice problems.

@
Andreas Bentz
/course/859
This was a very very good class. Definitely not easy, though, and definitely a weeder class, easy to fall behind in if you slacked off. The concepts seem misleadingly simple. There's not much math involved, and the material usually makes sense intuitively, so the tendency is to feel better prepared than you are. Reviewing the slides is not enough, because the exams test both comprehension and application. It's really mostly a critical thinking class.  Bentz's tests are notoriously hard, but they're hard in a fair way. If you miss a question, it's because you didn't understand a concept fully, and if you get him to explain it, it's very obvious what the right answer is and why. The best way to prepare for them is by practicing problems because that way you encounter little tricks that might show up on the tests. He doesn't make them too hard for people that really understand everything from class - if you know the material, you'll generally do well. But the tests really made me realize when I thought I'd understood something and didn't, fully.  The one really annoying thing about the grading is the scale, which makes it really hard to get an A (95-100%), normal difficulty to get an A- (90-94%), and progressively easier as you go down.  B+ = 85-90, B = 80 to 85, etc.  The best thing to do in this class is to work problems & ask questions obsessively, to force yourself to learn and understand the material. It's not much work & not much to memorize, mostly just knowing how to apply.  Studying in groups & explaining things to each other really helps.  The book is very good and interesting and the chapters follow the subjects he talks about in class pretty well (because he was involved in the publication.) The book isn't necessary - class notes are enough - but it can be helpful in explaining concepts.  Bentz is an excellent professor and really cares about helping students. He's also really smart, which can seem intimidating, but he's good at explaining concepts and making them make sense. His class is harder than the others but you also learn a lot more, & he's incredibly enthusiastic & makes the material really interesting.  Apparently other profs don't go as much in depth into the material and class is not as interesting, but Econ 1 is still an excellent course and covers material that everyone should know.

Professor Bentz's lectures are lucid and engaging.  Generally, I think all the praise people give him is warranted.  The only two things that I might have liked to know before taking his class is that a) his exams are much more difficult you'd expect given the relatively simple subject matter and b) he is usually cheerful but he can also be frosty at times.
@

/course/859
Easy in the regard that there is basically no homework except 6 problem sets.  Difficult in the regard that the tests are challenging and require that you make an active effort to do practice problems yourself.  Bentz is beyond organized, and therefore, so is this course...which is great.  the final exam was so sweet....
@
Andreas Bentz
/course/859
Class was great, although you might not even need the book because Bentz does such a good job in class and his tests were always reflective of what was covered in class. Although sometimes it was tough to stay awake, I think it was a factor of class being early in the morning and sometimes Andreas goes a little too slow in his lectures but he wants to make sure everyone understands it.  His PowerPoints were great and so was his sense of humor.  Highly recommend if you're an econ major or not.

Bentz is a good prof, definitly knows his stuff, and is super organized. He's just not that nice, but he pretends to be. He'll ask you to call him Andreas, but that doesn't mean he likes you or wants to be your friend. Don't take replies to your blitzes that ask him econ related questions personally; they'll come off as mean, they were probably intended to mean, and that's that. But be assured, your question will be answered even if he does make you feel like a fool in the end.

Prof. Bentz is really a great teacher. He thorougly explains everything in class and truly seems to care whether you understand the material or not. He tells you the book is supplemental, and in my opinion it's not necessary at all! His lectures are highly organized and often pretty entertaining too. My only drawback was that he purposefully puts a time pressure on you for the mid-terms (which he warns you about). Watch out for that on the first mid term especially, cause it's really easy to psych yourself out and waste time.

Econ 1 is notoriously boring so it was nice to have a prof who at least tried to liven it up a little. Instead of droning on about how the price of Good A effects demand for Good B, Bentz used the example of how a price drop on cheap beer leads to an increase in "demand" for teenage sex.   My only real complaint with Bentz was his grading system. He distributes test scores so that almost everyone gets a B-, B, or B+. The problem with this is that his tests are often not too difficult, so Bentz looks for any small mistakes so he can take points off and drag everyone down to some form of a B. This is frustrating when you know the material very well but make some tiny error on the test.   Overall, I recommend Bentz's Econ 1 class to anyone who is either shooting for a B or isn't prone to making small mistakes on tests.

Professor Bentz opened his introduction to Econ 1 by warning the class that we would teach for intended majors.  Econ 1 would be a difficult class, he warned us all; those of us with less than a passionate interest in Econ would do better to drop and enroll in Econ 2 instead.  You shouldn't believe him.  Econ 1--specifically, Bentz's Econ 1--was absolutely the highlight of my freshman winter, and is still one of the best classes I've taken at Dartmouth.  If you take only one econ course at Dartmouth, make sure it's Econ 1 with Bentz.  Hell, take it even if you're not planning on taking an Econ course at all.  It's that good.  You owe it to yourself.  This course is, without a doubt, made excellent by Bentz.  He's an all-around excellent professor--committed to his students, engaging in lecture, welcoming in office hours.  He does an excellent job explaining topics that can be confusing and are frequently boring in a lively manner, and he prints power-point presentations for every topic that you can use in class for easy note-taking.  Bentz makes learning Econ easy and fun, and he'll go to all lengths to make sure that you understand the material he presents in class.  This is an important point, because (as Bentz warns) the class is not easy.  The majority of your grade will come from two midterms and a final; six problem sets (none of which are easy) make up the last bit, but he drops the worst grade of the six.  The tests are tough; you'll need to know the material well and be able to put it into practice to earn a good grade.  But Bentz goes out of his way to make himself available during office hours, and hold review sessions before each test, so it's more or less your own fault if you don't understand the material well enough.  The book is a little less helpful than Bentz.  I found the readings were very helpful during the early parts of the course, especially since I came in with no prior Econ experience and was unfamiliar with a lot of the terms and concepts.  However, later in the course, Bentz tends to teach in his own manner; the book technically covers the same material and the same problems, but tends to present things in a slightly different way, just different enough to be confusing.  I don't believe Bentz makes you buy the book, so if you can borrow it at your leisure, don't spend the money.  On the other hand, it's well written and rather entertaining, so if you simply enjoy acquiring textbooks, it'll be a nice addition to your bookshelf.  Econ 1 is one of those courses everyone ought to take during college, and Bentz is one of the professors everyone at Dartmouth should have the privledge of learning from.  Take this course.

Professor Bentz seems very nice and is funny during class but is a tough grader when it comes time for exams.

If you want to learn alot and dont mind taking a hit in your GPA take this class.  If you want to learn a good amount and would like to at least maintain you GPA take Econ 1 with another prof, but no matter what you decide take Econ 1 it's one of those courses that every Dartmouth student should take.

i took this course as a 3rd course that i didnt care too much about. i had some econ in high school which i thought was fairly interesting. this course goes over the basics of econ in a very uninteresting way. the material is very dry. only take if you're an econ major or want a course with very little work. bentz gave good lectures, his grading system is a little weird though. (due to the nature of his curving, it is easy to get a b/b+ but hard to get an a)
@

This was a great course. I will warn you though that it is certainly not easy and you need to be willing to study hard for the tests, but it's a course everyone should take but it's so practical.  The class was 2 exams, a final, and some problem sets. The problem sets were kindof hard and tricky often, but you never really needed to do any reading because Bentz was so good at presenting it in class. I would recommend definitely going to class all the time because it's really worth it and he is a great prof and can present concepts well.  To succeed on tests, DO PRACTICE EXAMS, seriously, do all of them, they help SO much and sometimes he reuses mult. choice questions.  Bentz is great, material is stuff everyone should learn, and the course is definitely worth it, just don't think it's going to be a cakewalk.

Don't make my mistake and ask an Econ genius if Econ 1 is hard! If you have no background in Econ and didn't take any kind of economics classes in high school, be prepared to work hard.  The material is interesting, and Bentz's classes will really make you want to get up in the morning.  However, the three tests are very demanding - much more than you'd think based on Bentz's classes. Bentz also tends to teach the general concept and expect you to figure out how to do the equations and make it work - make sure you do more than just the workouts he assigns.  Many kids had to drop after the first test. It is a worthwhile class to take, but don't figure on it being easy

This class is the absolute best.  Bentz made me want to be an Econ major.  If you have to take Econ 1, don't take it with anybody else. His lectures are incredibly organized, he is the only prof I've ever seen who uses powerpoint effectively as a supplemental resources during lectures.  He is interesting, funny, and coherent.  He obviously loves students and is very helpful and responsive outside of class.  You need to stay caught up with the reading in order to do well on the exams (particularly the second one, which comes at a really bad time for everyone).  But overall it is not too difficult, and it is one of the more interesting econ classes you'll have a chance to take. Everyone should take it because it gives you such a good grasp of real world situations. Additionally, Bentz is really cute so there's an extra bonus to getting up and going to class every day.
@
Andreas Bentz
/course/859
Econ 1 is generally a dull, straightforward class, but bentz makes econ 1 a worthwhile class.  He has very comical movements and interesting stories often reminds you of that of an adorable child.  But aside from personality, his teaching methods are amazing.  He often zooms out of the concepts he is teaching to show you the greater framework of how the concept is connected to everything else, and takes the time to make sure everyone understands the subject at hand.  Don't buy a text, because he doesn't really use it and the tests and workouts rely mainly on his powerpoint presentations.  As long as you practice old finals that he posts up on blackboard, you can ace the final.  Most definitely, take this class if you get Bentz.
@
Andreas Bentz
/course/859
Going into this class I knew that the exams were going to be tough, but that in the end it would be worth it. Professor Bentz is great and he is really easy to approach if you have any problems.  The tests are pretty tough, and curves don't exist in this class, so C's aren't too uncommon in his class.  If you're looking for an easy A (or an A at all) in econ 1, you probably won't find it here. If you're looking to master the basics of microeconomics, however, this is the perfect class.

Supposedly, Econ 1 with Professor Bentz is more difficult than with other professors in the department.  However, I really enjoyed this course, partly because Professor Bentz's lectures were so enthusiastic.  He really loves economics, which is evident in class.  The "workouts" are a good review of the material, and they don't take too long to complete.  I would recommend joining a study group, as mine was really useful.  Also, it is a very good idea to use the old exams he posts online when preparing for midterms and the final.

This is a great course. The prof is interesting, and for the light workload it is definitely a course you should take.   But be sure you review before midterm and finals, some questions can be tricky.  In all, I have to say I enjoyed this course the most this term. Prof Bentz is a great lecturer, and classes are really interesting. (Yes, do go. He tested the class during midterms on something he didn't put in the notes but explained in class)

Bentz typed everything he said in class and put it on Blackboard as a slideshow-very helpful.  He was mildly interesting and had a definite sense of humor, but it was frustrating know that Giummo graded everything much easier-on one test we had a lower class average and no curve while they got one.  Despite this, I'd still recommend taking the class with Bentz.

prof. bentz is excellent, yet his lectures and the textbook are interchangeable. Between the new Krugman textbook that is "fun" and readable, and his powerpoint lectures posted on BB, attending class feels a little redundant. Also, careful on the workouts - tricky - then again, the points arent that valuable
@
Andreas Bentz

This is a great class if you are at all mathematically inclined.  Everything just makes sense, and Bentz does a great job being enthusiastic about the material.  He's so happy about economics that he seems like a kid in a candy store when he gets going.  He also is very clear about the course material, even though sometimes it feels like he goes a little bit too slowly through the material.  Each class he goes through a review of what we learned in the last class, which is extremely helpful if you missed the previous class, because everything you learn in the class is built off of previous material.  The homework and topics in class are fairly easy to understand, however, the tests are quite a bit trickier.

don't miss out on this prof. he is great, it would be a shame to take econ 1 with anyone else.  the class isn't a lot of work if you are a math-y person. i spend about an hour on each of 6 workouts in the term and a couple of hours before each midterm and the final...pretty sweet...if you are bad with analytical stuff, you would need to put in a lot more time
@
Andreas Bentz
/course/859
The class is great and the professor is very interesting and helful, if you take Econ 1 you want to take it with Bentz. But the test are a little difficult and challenging, and it is not as easy as the other Econ 1 classes.
@
Andreas Bentz
/course/859
Bentz is the one to take econ1 with.. he's a good prof with enthusiasm and explains everything pretty clearly. He makes everything seem fairly easy, but when you actually do the questions yourself, you might have some difficulty, unless you really understand the concept. Stay on top of the material/classwork, and you'll be just fine.
@
Andreas Bentz

i felt that the professor really tried to help the students, but when it came to exams, there were some problems that just did not match what we were studying.  Never did we go into depth of things during lectures which made everyone believe that the material was easy, but when we had to take exams, we felt unprepared.  Also, the textbook used did not even help since it did not even provide any of the answers to the problems to see if we understood the material.  Overall, I believe this course needs a different direction and the material needs to be taught in a more effective way.

This course is a great intro. to the basics of economics.  If you can draw lines, figure out their slopes, and do basic algebra (I'm talking multiplying and dividing) then you will have no problem with this course.  Prof. Bentz is great -- funny and interesting, his lectures are effective and if you go to class every day you won't need the book at all.  I never visited his office hours but he seems to make himself pretty available for help if you need it.  Homework is minimal -- one problem set a week for six weeks and then nothing more.  Only five of the six count, so you don't have to do all of them, and each problem set takes 2 hours at most.  The class is paced a little bit slowly but you'll still learn a lot; I definitely recommend this course, especially if you're looking for something both easy and interesting.

This was my first exposure to economics, and I was not disappointed. Although it was my first term on campus and I thus had some problems with my study habits, Professor Bentz was very understanding and good-natured about helping me. I found the course material to be easy to grasp and the work quite relevant. The only warnings I would give would be to make sure you attend class and that you keep up with the book, as this will make things much easier for you. I have a great deal of respect for Professor Bentz (or Andreas as he prefers to be called) and will definitely be taking more classes with him in the future. A good choice.

Econ 1 with Bentz is a really good class because he explains the concepts really well. For people who already have a background in econ, the class may be really slow at times. However, I would advise people to keep going to class because Bentz is a good lecturer and it's really easy to get behind in the class. Also, the exams tend to be really tricky so watch out.
@
Andreas Bentz
/course/859
Econ 1 was ok. The best part is that if you attend classes, you don't need to do much reading. Be very careful though, exams are fair, but questions may be tricky and must be paid a lot of attention too. If you have to take the class, take it with Bentz!
@
Andreas Bentz
/course/859
The bottom line is that this is an interesting class with fun lectures. The prof has lots off cool stories, interesting examples, and is over all a funny guy. For example, you get to learn about the Cross-price elasticity of demand for cheap beer and gonorrhea! However, it would have been easier for me if there were more math. I'm probably the exception, but I believe that it would have helped if it was admitted that the lines on all the graphs we drew (and we drew lots of graphs) were functions and that we were often taking the derivative of these functions. I think it would have lead to a deeper understanding of the subject (not to mention that in AP calc we covered in less than a day what it took over a week to cover in this class). However, many topics couldn't have been improved by more math, so it's not a huge deal.

@
Andreas Bentz
/course/859
Bentz is an excellent teacher and he presents the material in a very clear concise manner. He is available for questions both inside and outside of class.  The main drawback is that the only practice problems he provides are from former exams. Since he has revamped the course, these are helpful, but do not cover everything. The book problems are not anything like his and the problems at the back are useless because they don't have answers. Thus something that you are totally unprepared for is likely to show up on the test. Other than that he is a great professor and makes the class interesting and fun.
@

If you take ECON 1, make sure to take it with Bentz.  He makes class entertaining while still doing a great job of teaching the material.  He knows his stuff and knows how to explain it clearly.
@
Andreas Bentz
/course/859
This Prof writes some tricky tests. You have very little work to do outside of class, and in-class lectures are very basic views of the material. The tests are unfortunately not as basic as the lectures, and he really forces you to come up with answers to tricky questions on tests that he never explored in class. Other than the midterms and final, the class involves very little consistent work.
@
Andreas Bentz
/course/859
First of all, despite negative aspects of this class, DO NOT take this class from anyone but Bentz.  I heard Giummo put his kids to sleep everyday, which I think is echoed in other reviews on this site, but it's kind of sad he hasn't read the reviews and tried to fix his lecture style.  Second of all, if you are not a planned ECON major or have to take it for some other major, seriously consider taking ECON 2 (which Bentz kindly suggests to his students the first day of class).  Bentz's lectures are entertaining and often interactive.  His accent became a nice alarm clock in the morning, and his bad jokes about Economics professors were always entertaining.  Overall, Bentz is a great guy, with the best interests of his students in mind.  He really wants to make a difference at Dartmouth, and for a department that is known for its horrible professors (how can an entire department be notorious for bad professors -- President Wright or whoever hires these people??), Bentz is a breath of fresh air.  I was nervious taking this class because I heard Bentz was harder, and I wish I had taken the advice of previous students to study for the exams by doing EVERY SINGLE practice exam Bentz provides.  It might seem excessive, but extremely necessary.  See this is the catch, Bentz is great and all, but he wants you to apply the stuff you learn in class on your own.  So you can show up to the test and have to think about the dense theory behind Bentz's simple examples and apply it.  So if you take the practice exams, you won't make the all-too-common mistake of being a student that undestands the material lightly, but falls for Bentz's very, very attractive "sucker answers."  In fact, as we learned in class, Bentz's opportunity cost of not writing SAT I sucker answers is probably much higer than the benefits of working at Dartmouth and receiving what is probably a meager salary for "Visiting Assitant Professor" compared to the disgusting, inflated salaries that the Parkhurst gods and their marble floors enjoy.  I think Bentz should provide more difficult examples in class, or at the very least more workouts for students to play with the material.  The book wasn't extremely necessary to read, and I did my best on the final when I didn't read the last section of the book, but I don't know if that is coincidental or not.  It's kind of nice to read the book because it is basically verbatum what Bentz says in class, except for different examples.  It was kind of sad to see him only mentioned once in the book when it was obvious he was a serious contributer.  Despite any negativities, just being in Bentz's class is worth it, even if you only go to his office hours and play with his toy airplanes.  So your choices are first ECON 1 or not, then if it's Giummo/some other random versus Bentz, your decision is boring ECON 1, if a bit easier, or fascinating lectures and tougher exams.  I would suggest facebooking Bentz, you could become his friend and ask more questions.

Professor Bentz's class was very interesting and rewarding; I highly recommend it. This was the first time I have ever taken economics, and I feel that Professor Bentz helped me learn a great deal. He is a wonderful and motivated lecturer, and he inspired in me such an interest for economics that I now plan to either major or minor in it. Professor Bentz is also always ready to help outside of class.  The tests can be tough; however, if you review the material over time, as Professor Bentz suggests, and read the book to reinforce what you have learned in class, you will learn a great deal and earn an excellent grade. This class will not provide you with an easy A, but if you want to have good knowledge of the subject and have fun in the class, definitely take it. Also, if you have a chance, sign up for an econ. study group.  Overall, this is a great class with an amazing professor.

This was my favorite class this term.  Bentz is a fabulous teacher.  If you're going to take Econ 1, take it with him!  His lectures are engaging, he is enthusiastic about the subject, and he makes things very clear and interesting.  Just go to class and you'll be fine- you'll barely have to study for the tests at all.  Don't bother doing the reading - just study class notes and you'll be fine because he doesn't put anything on the exams that he didn't cover in class.  This is a great class - take it with Bentz!

intro to economics is important for everyone.

This class is what you would expect from an intro class. Prof. Bentz is an interesting prof, but he will not cover any problems in class, which may or may not bother you, depending on how you learn. The concepts are pretty simple, and you don't really need to buy the text.

this was a basic intro course for econ. the material was fairly interesting. unfortunately, the use of powerpoint for every single lecture did not help me learn the material very well. also, the tests were rather tricky. the homework didn't help me learn the material very well or help me prepare for the exams. still, bentz is a nice guy and is available to give help during office hours.

I really liked Prof. Bentz.  He is supposed to be a harder prof. and a tougher grader but I think he is worth taking because he is much more lively and informative in class.  There is not too much work and going to class is optional.  Overall its a pretty good class.

Bentz is a great prof. As a non-major who had never taken any econ before, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I ended up learning a lot and only missed one class. He's very organized, funny, and doesn't test on anything he doesn't cover in lecture. The book is helpful and interesting but definitely not mandatory.   At first I thought the tests (2 midterms and a final) were too hard because they're pretty tricky, but by the time the final rolled around, I could admit that I had learned more from really being tested. If you want to give econ a try, Bentz is definitely the prof to take if from.

I would highly suggest taking econ 1 as a useful class that is actually interesting.  It was challenging, but not overly so, and it was rewarding to do well and achieve understandment.  Bentz helped make it this way, and so if he sticks around to teach other classes, I would recommend one with him.

I took this course thinking it would be a good, easy introduction to Economics.  It turned out to be my worst class ever---maybe it was just me, but the material made no sense to me.  The textbook didn't help at all, and after a while, every unit looked exactly the same  powerpoint slides with various graphs and curves.  I couldn't tell the difference between the final unit and the first unit.  Bentz tended to get sidetracked during class by that one kid who asked too many questions.  I think he would be a good prof. for most people, but he didn't help me at all.  If you can stay focused and attend the classes (which will no doubt be early in the morning), then this is probably a good course for you.  Otherwise, stay away, because it's not as basic and simple as you might think.

Professor Bentz is by far the best professor I've had at Dartmouth so far.  He presented information clearly and was always able to help or clarify if you had any questions.

It's good information to know, it was just challenging enough, and it was an enjoyable experience overall.

Professor Bentz is amazing. He delivers good lectures that students can relate to by using real world examples, and he will take the time to answer any questions that you may have, no matter how long we have already spent on that subject. I wasn't sure if I was going to like econ, but after a term with Bentz, I wanted to take more econ classes. The tests are not difficult if you do the homework and study. The homework is manageable, and the textbook is not really needed to get it done. If you're thinking about taking econ 1, take it with Bentz. You won't regret it.

I don't know if I'd recommend this class if you're not planning on going into econ at all... I found it pretty boring... but you will love Bentz!!!

All the stuff on the website is great, adn all the workouts and practice exams really help with the studying.  Bentz is mad funny and a really cool guy outside of class, found myself in his office and exchanging blitzes about skiiing, mountain biking, etc.. Econ 1 in itself is really easy and tedious, but Bentz makes class interesting.  Accept no substitutes, this is where you want to take econ 1.
@
Andreas Bentz
/course/859
Bentz is a very good lecturer and generally handled in-class questions well.  I never went to office hours, but he was conscientious about responding to blitzed questions.  The course itself was occasionally challenging and some of the test questions were designed to be tricky.  I think if you didn't understand the material, it was very easy to do poorly in the class (the tests were much harder to BS than in other courses).  All in all, it was pretty thorough and interesting and very small for an intro class.

Word to potential economists  Don't take econ 1 without Bentz!  The other profs just don't cut it.  Bentz is the coolest cat on the block.  I would have had fun in that class learning about the mating patterns of the one-eyed manatee.  He's quite a character, absolutely adorable, and makes economics interesting and fun.  Not only is the class entertaining, but you are really inspired to learn the material.   His tests are reputed to be challenging, but with ample preparation they're a breeze.  I never once used the textbook, because his lectures plus the slide presentations (available on blackboard) were everything I needed to study.   Tips on acing the class DO THE SAMPLE TESTS!  He posts them before each exam, and if you do enough and grade yourself, it won't be long before you're exposed to every sort of question he can ask.  You'll get the hang of what he looks for, and you'll get the optimal answers for the short answer questions (mostly definitions). JOIN A STUDY GROUP!!  Thirty bucks may seem like a lot, but unless you have a bunch of friends in the class who you can study with (and who are less clueless than you) this is the best way to get your questions answered.  I'd look at the homework and be confused out of my mind, but going to the study group, I could discuss and answer my questions, and feel confident about the material.  It was definitely well worth the cost.

This was a very enjoyable course.  Bentz is a great professor and quite a funny lecturer.  I thought I liked econ before taking the course but now I like it even more.  If you are thinking about taking econ 1 be sure to take it with Bentz, though it may be a bit more difficult than with other profs, you'll be sure to learn more.  The only slight problem with it is Bentz teaches off of slides which he gives you copies of so note-taking can be an issue.  Overall, Bentz is a great guy who really knows how to teach economics.

Okay, here is the deal This class does stuff one can directly use in life. It is a great course, and especially thanks to Professor Bentz, who frankly makes the material very close-to-life with practical examples and good, clear explanations, it is also fun. The HW and exams are on the hard side, but they always consist of stuff he has done in class.  So if you are willing to keep your ears open, and work a bit, this course can change your life. It certainly exceeded my expectations.

Econ 1 with Professor Bentz was recommended to me by a friend who took it last year and I was so glad that I took it and that I took it with Bentz.  He is easily one of the best professors I have had here at Dartmouth.  His excitement about econ and teaching is really obvious in his lectures, which are all on Powerpoint but he also gives you a hard copy of all of the slides before each new section begins, and he inspires interest in the subject.  Bentz will basically use any teaching method that works to get you to learn the subject and frequently asks if there is anything the class would like him to do to make the course better.  The workouts require some work and knowledge of what is going on, but if you need help he is really willing to work with students during office hours.  The exams are long (about 9 pages usually) and you have to work quickly as they are given during the 65 minute class time.  Practice exams are given out from past years and studying those, in addition to going to the review session he holds, are a great prep for the midterms.  If you know the material, then you will do well on the tests but be prepared to not just memorize a few facts from the slides - you need to be able to apply the material to be able to do the problems.  Overall, one of the best courses offered here with a great professor - highly recommended!

Prof Bentz is very enthusiastic in class.  He makes what could otherwise be a very dull course quite interesting.  The tests are challenging but fair.

This is a good course... the coverage of topics is excellent... the homework is "to the point"... but don't get your hopes up when exams come around, they are not as easy the homework, or as abstract as your understanding of the material... make sure you review previous years' exams and you will do well.    Overall, this course is among the better courses I have taken here... primarily do to an interesting professor, who is genuine about teaching and a just grader.    Science-whiz kids, stick to science.  English buffs, stick to writing.  Religion majors, ahh.. yeah, you too.

Bentz is my hero.  He's animated and funny in class and managed to keep me awake at 845 three days a week.  His tests won't stray from the lecture material, and while they are quite hard are manageable if you understand the concepts and know the terms behind them.  Overall, a good course made by a great prof. Beware some of what you learn might actually apply in the real world.
@
Andreas Bentz
/course/859
Professor Bentz is really an amazing educator.  It's clear that he loves the subject and teaching in general, and his energy was the only thing that kept me awake for those 845 classes.  He goes at a good pace, and waits for everyone to catch up.  It's not too slow, though.  The material itself is interesting enough.  It's a good class to have freshman fall- I feel like I've learned a lot and gotten a good introductino to economics.    The only problems I have with Professor Bentz are his classroom reactions and his test questions.  I think the tests are pretty fair, but some of the questions just expect too much, or are worded so you have to think exactly like Professor Bentz.  For example, the short answer questions make it impossible to get full points, because he expects you to know EVERYTHING there is to know about the term.  Also, while I appreciate his gender sensitive classroom speech, I found asking questions incredibly difficult.  He always looks at you like you're stupid when you ask something, or he seems impatient with some people.  There's one boy in the other section of his class that asks a lot of strange questions, and the entire class starts laughing every time he speaks, at least when our sections join for study sessions.  Professor Bentz contributes to this student's humilitation by not bothering to conceal his irritation, a habit that made me give him an A- rather than an A+.  I guess don't let that stop you from taking this class, but take advantage of office hours.  He's a little nicer then.  Overall, he really is an admirable prof, and I wish I had more like him.

There is so much to cover! Don't let one person hold you guys up. If someone has a question that is behind the class, have a look on your face like, "who cares, let's move on" or if someone is asking a question that is too in depth for what you are learning, have that same face on. prof bentz is VERY RESPONSIVE to the look on your face. if enough of you have that look, he will silence the student. It is worth it. we had one guy who kept asking questions, which were, granted, insightful. But many times, just before a test, we would be rushed to make up for the 5-10 minutes  a day we wasted.  Help the prof become more streamlined in his lectures. he will if you help him.

This prof. is a really good guy... hes not too old and out of touch with the world, so his in class examples about beer and pizza make a really boring topic interesting.  Most people that i have spoken to found that his exams were too difficult.  I thought they were tricky and very hard to complete in just 65 minutes.  Anyways, Bentz is the best econ 1 prof, and he makes a boring class tolerable with his lectures.

Having no background in economics whatsoever, I felt that the material gave a good introduction to the field without being too dense to understand. I don't know if the course description or course title fit the course, but that doesn't matter. It was a good course anyway. It's tough to sustain the energy required to understand some of the more difficult concepts but overall it is a really good overview and introduction to the thought process economists go through. Even this course was fascinating, I do not think I will continue with any more economics courses, because there are other subjects I would like to pursue here at Dartmouth. Except, if I can't find a more creative way to get rid of the other required SOC credit...
@
Andreas Bentz
/course/859
The material Dr. Bentz covers in class is comprehensive and the fact that he does a good job in covering a good deal of material will leave you with a better sense of contiuation in the field of economics. Andreas Bentz makes the class better than it would be otherwise.  Some tend to consider the field of study boring, but he brings a youthful tone and adds anecdotes and real-life situations that make the class and the subject interesting. His outline for the material is well-presented and summerized on his powerpoint slides they provide good access for studying and homework, and make clear the material you need to know in the class. If you put consistent, quality effort into the homework, you will be well prepared for the exams, and will have an easier time comprehending the material. Be prepared for thorough exams They take an above-average concentration and preparation, and tend to take up the full allotment of class time.   The text book is questionable. It provides additional understanding on top of the class lectures and powerpoint slides, and also gives historical and relevent examples of the material. If you pay close attention in lecture, and find the slides clear, using the reference books at Baker can avoid the 95 expense.

This class was quite challenging due to the difficulty in grasping some of the concepts, as well as the tests given by Bentz.  However, given a little time you can really do well.  There is also a minimal amount of homework.

Curtis is great and her lectures are great. But if you're not a quick test taker, then this class will be super challenging. I knew all the content but those exams were so rushed.

I was told to take this class with Curtis and I couldn't have asked for a better professor. She explains everything so well, and makes really complicated topics seem easy with in-class games and exercises to mimic the real world. She holds so many office hours and really encourages us to come to them. Grading is strict, though, and it is generally hard to get an amazing grade, but if you want to learn then take it with Curtis.

Easy course. Great prof. The tests are stupid, because the multiple choice are worth 3.33% each, and sometimes they're curveballs. Sometimes MC answers that are technically right are still wrong because another answer is slightly better. Be careful and you'll do great. Tests get curved though, so all good. 10/10 would take again with Curtis.

Amazing professor, excellent at explaining economics in real world terms. Nothing in the readings is very difficult, but Professor Curtis does have fairly brutal tests. Keep up with the problem sets and make sure you study a reasonable amount and this will be a fairly light, enjoyable course.

Take this class with Elizabeth Curtis, and with a friend! Professor Curtis explains concepts very clearly, offers frequent office hours, and lets you work in groups of two on problem sets (so having a friend who works hard in the class really helps)!

Econ 1 has the reputation of being a harder class, but I found the material quite easy and the workload more than manageable. Read the textbook, do the practice problems, review the Powerpoints, and ask questions when you have them (Curtis has tons of office hours and is more than willing to schedule more to help). Not very challenging at all, but a very important and worthwhile class to take. Recommend taking it with Curtis—she's very clear in class and tells you everything you possibly need to know. Midterms were very straightforward and everything you would expect, and the final was also very reasonable. Do the work and you'll get an A-, put in a little extra time studying and get an A.

Thank God that's over. Ah yes, infamous ECON 1 at Dartmouth. Challenging course that really depends on the professor. I thought Curtis was very helpful, a great lecturer, sweet in office hours, but hard. B - median.... that was the lowest median grade at Dartmouth 16W other than Math 3. Some people joke that ECON 1 is just full of freshman who think it's "hard," but isn't really... I suppose that's up to you. If I took this course as a senior, I'd probably crush it... so tread lightly young ones.

Course This was the most straight-forward class I've taken at Dartmouth.  It was well paced.  It's not a super interesting class, but I feel like the concepts are important to know about.

Prof. Curtis is fantastic. She’s a very nice, well-organized person, who cares about her students and wants to ensure that they understand the material. She holds office hours quite frequently and grades very quickly.  Also, Curtis actually makes Econ 1 fairly interesting. Her pacing of the course is good and she explains all the concepts with great clarity. Her power point presentations are great; for the most part, you don’t really need the textbook as long as you go to her lectures and study from the power points.   The course is not a lot of work. You just need to do the weekly problem set and study for the exams (2 midterms, each worth 20% of the grade, and a final worth 40%). The problem sets are not particularly hard, and they effectively reinforce your understanding of the course material.  The exams are fair. Some questions might be slightly harder than those from the problem sets, but the sample exams (which Curtis posts on blackboard before each of the exams) will give you a good idea about the difficulty of the actual exams. Many of the reviews say that Curtis throws curveballs at you on the exams, but that’s simply not true. Though some questions might be relatively difficult, overall it’s nothing extraordinary. The only problem with midterms is the time constraint (you need to have a good grasp of the material to finish everything in time), but for the final she gives you more time than you need. Overall, the course was not extremely difficult; I did not take any econ classes in high school, but still ended up with an A.  All in all, if you want to take Econ 1, Curtis is the obvious choice.

Easily the best Economics professor I have had in my entire life. I lost interest in econ in high school because I had a relatively bad professor, and decided to take Econ 1 here because it's the department at Dartmouth with the highest reputation and it was one of the best choices I made so far.  Curtis is incredible, her 65 minute lectures are crammed with info and still manage to fly by. Intro econ is never the most varied and interesting subject but Curtis managed to make it a class that i attended 100% of lectures for just because her lectures were so useful and made you almost instantly understand what she was talking about.  Even though she used powerpoint slides and recommended we write whatever extra notes we would like to take to the side of printouts of the slide, I never did this as unlike other profs, her lectures always related to the powerpoints she was flicking through, but was never the same and so I found it much more useful to just take down all the notes I needed instead of skipping over bits already on the Powerpoint since the way she explained them made all the points really clear.  It is econ, so the curve is pretty harsh, I think you need a mid 90s% average for an A and 90% is an A- so this is in no way an easy class. If you're interested in econ though, this class is great, and even if you're not, Curtis is a great prof and will probably get you hooked.
@
Elisabeth Curtis
/course/859
The 2 midterms are way too long and test your speed and not your knowledge of the material. There is more time on the final.  Curtis teaches from powerpoints. The ones she makes herself are good but occasionally she gets lazy and uses the standard powerpoint provided by the textbook -- those aren't nearly as good and going to class is pretty useless on the days she uses those powerpoints.  Problem sets, due once  a week, aren't too tough and if you go to office hours she'll pretty much give you the answer.  It's econ 1 so it's not  a very exciting course. Curtis tries her best to make it interesting but she clearly prefers macro to micro so she gets bored with the material too.
@
Elisabeth Curtis
/course/859
Curtis is a fantastic professor.  She is interesting and gives good lectures, is a fair grader, and is very helpful during office hours, if you can manage to get her attention.  This is difficult, though, because the office hours before a problem set or an exam are often full of people, and it can be tough to get a turn in asking a question.  Besides the wonderful Curtis, the class itself is mediocre.  The exams are much more difficult than the material would suggest, which would be fine if there were practice exams.  But, there aren't, and a lot of people go in thinking that since the material is easy, the exam will be as well.  False.  Also, the problem sets are very easy, and take no more than an hour.  But, take it anyway, since even if you don't need the class, you should get the background in econ anyways.
@
Elisabeth Curtis
/course/859
the material seems easy. in class, she makes everything seem so logical and simple. then she throws a curveball with the tests. they're long and difficult. barely anyone finished the first one on time. the final was very hard. she's helpful in office hours. if you want to succeed, read and go to office hours and do many practice problems. considered a "weed out" class, it wont be easy unless you have motivation and put work into it (or have prior knowledge of econ). I wish she brought more contemporary issues to light (housing crisis, credit, trade deficits, etc.). i guess as an econ 1 class, you know what to expect textbook definitions and memorizing graphs
@

I just decided last minute to take Econ 1 just cuz  everyone at Dartmouth takes it. A lot of my upperclassmen friends said to take it with Curtis so I did.  She made the class a lot more bearable and much more interesting than the other sections of econ 1 (from what I heard from my friends in other sections). The in class group assignment is an easy boost to your grade, as are the problem sets.  The midterm and final are harder than the problem sets and practice sample exams, though, so definitely do some problems from the book. Curtis is really really nice person and an amazing lecturer. She's helpful outside of class and I showed up to the final 45 minutes late and she was really nice about it. Bottom line take Econ with Curtis
@
Elisabeth Curtis
/course/859
I think econ is one those subjects that everybody should have a basic understanding of, but avoid Curtis at ALL costs. I almost failed the class because of her ridiculous exams that are designed to catch students out even if they know the material.  Both my parents are economists and my roommate was an econ major and even they could not correctly answer some of the test questions. About half the class withdrew after the mid-term. Curtis also cut her office hours way back towards the end of the term because of house renovations, and as somebody else said, you will learn way more about her kids than economics.  She also makes intuitive concepts much more complicated than they needed to be.  DO NOT take it with this professor, i guarantee you will regret it.

Curtis is one of the most amazing teachers I have ever had. She is caring, engaging, enthusastic, hard working, clear, organized, and skilled at teaching. She is great in office hours and very approachable and kind.  Econ 1 is EASY. If you do the reading. Go to class, and do the problem sets, you'll be fine. Everything is intuitive "if the price of a good increases, what happens to quantity demanded?" not hard, right?  Take this class! Even if you aren't a major, I think it's worth taking. This class makes the perfect easy third. And it's worth your time. and seriously, Curtis is awesome.
@
Elisabeth Curtis
/course/859
Curtis is great. She is always available during office hours and provides powerpoints on each chapter which basically make the textbook unnecessary. You don't need to do a whole lot of work outside of class except for the weekly problem sets and studying for tests. The problem sets can be done with a partner, aren't too difficult, really help you learn the material and make up 20% of your grade. There are two tests worth 20% of your grade and one 40% final. They cover the course material well but Curtis will throw curveballs at you with material in ways that you haven't seen before.
@
Elisabeth Curtis

Professor Curtis is really nice, but her lectures are extremely boring. The lecture and the homework readings are the exact same thing, so it felt like a waste to do both.  The material is really dry and I think that's just because it's an intro class.  No real problems with Curtis, although the weekly problem sets are much easier than the midterm exams so you feel like you are better prepared than you actually are.

I'm a senior math major and found this class extremely easy and enjoyable.  Curtis is a dynamic professor, very approachable, and very fair.  Some of the exams had one or two obscure questions, but overall, great class.  Grading is based on 2 non-cumulative midterms, weekly problem sets (super easy), and a cumulative final.  Curtis posts old exams on Blackboard - use them to study.  Make sure you can do the calculations quickly... some people had trouble finishing the midterms in class.

Professor Curtis is, from what I hear, the best lecturer of the Econ 1 profs. I learned a lot from her class.  At the same time, she is also the toughest grader with the toughest exams. So I guess it's a trade off. If you want to have an easier time or buffer your GPA, try someone else. But if you really want to learn the material, take it with Curtis.
@
Elisabeth Curtis

This is pretty much exactly what you'd expect from an intro-level econ class. Although the material can be a bit slow and dull at times, Professor Curtis is an engaging lecturer and helps to keep things interesting.  You'll have to do a problem set a week, which only takes an hour or two, in addition to reading the chapters and studying for the tests. Overall, if you pay attention in class, the course isn't too difficult. If you're interested in econ and want to know more about it, definitely take Econ 1.
@

/course/859
Curtis is the best professor. She explains the material very clearly and gives very good examples. Her lectures are very effective, so don't miss them!   The tests can be a little tricky, so be sure that you really know your stuff. For multiple choice questions, it's good to understand why the other options are incorrect, this can help you understand the material. Also the hardest part about tests is finishing them within 65 minutes. If you've studied and are ready you will be fine, but if you spend too much time on one problem you may not finish.  Take Econ 1 with Curtis!!

curtis is an excellent professor that spends a ton of time and energy trying to get you to understand econ concepts. take any and all opportunities to go to her office hours and ask questions, she'll explain whatever you don't get.   make sure that you study the problem sets for the exams, the same type of questions reappear. and make sure to budget your time on the exam, seeing as there's a lot of questions to cover in 2 hours!  if you are interested in taking econ 1, take it with curtis, she makes it enjoyable.

.... do mediocre in. I'm one of those cocky types of students who look at the B median and say "oh that's because the rest of the students are stupid." FALSE! Don't think you can come on in and expect to get an A. Curtis's median is a B for a reason. There will be people who will get A's... but the large plurality will get B's. Here's how it will play out. You'll do the hws.... get above the medians on those. Then, the test will come, and a nice little surprise will come. She'll ask you to apply a concept in a new fashion. And be ready because it is coming! You don't know exactly where the curve is going to get you. I finally caught on by the final and was ready for it. But before then, you just really didn't know.   The means on the two midterms were about 79.   I'll be lucky to end up with a B+...   The concepts in the course are product production frontiers (gains from trade), supply and demand, elasticity of demand and supply, utility analysis (what is the best combo for a person to buy to achieve maximum happiness) in both math and graphical form (that is going to be the part of the class that bites you in the butt), perfect competition, monopolies, monopolistic competition, oligopolies, externalities of the market (public goods).   Oligopolies and game theory (very basic) was the best part of the course imho.   On Curtis, nice, friendly prof. She wants you to learn the material. But you'll get a little frustrated when there are tests that have too little time and have problems that aren't supported by the test.  I don't want to discourage you from taking the class, but when you look up and aren't getting an A, just don't be shocked.
@
Elisabeth Curtis

Not the most interesting course but Curtis is really helpful and wants everyone to understand the material.  You have to draw a lot of graphs. The tests really aren't too difficult, and the problem sets contribute to your grade more than you first realize.
@
Elisabeth Curtis
/course/859
Curtis was a really good professor for this course. She made concepts very simple and approachable and didn't over-complicate things like I have heard a lot of the other econ 1 profs do. She was very organized--her lectures were all on powerpoints, so aside from drawing graphs, you didn't even really need to take notes, just add things to the powerpoint slide print outs. The homework was pretty easy and the exams were the same. Overall, I didn't find the course that interesting, but Curtis is the prof to pick if you want to take it and the course seemed pretty easy and had a minimal work load.
@
Elisabeth Curtis
/course/859
While I do believe that Curtis effectively TAUGHT me the material, I don't think she effectively TESTED us on it.  It seemed pretty clear that her tests were either questions taken from a textbook different from our own, or were meant to be "trick" questions.  Often, the first experience I would have with certain material, was when it appeared as a question on the test.  With that said, Curtis is very nice, and is very responsive during and outside of class.
@
Elisabeth Curtis

curtis is an amazing lecturer. her tests aren't so bad either; i was well-prepared for them, and as long as i didn't take too long to go through them, i was fine.  the course was great all-around, so i feel like nitpicking a little here - the textbook could be better. this is intro to micro, after all, so there must be lots of more interesting versions out there. mankiw, for one, is much clearer and easier to read, imo. - the powerpoint slides could be a little more concise. these are basically what you study from, so it would be more helpful to have short bullet points and diagrams instead of sentences and paragraphs. - i know it's an intro class, but i would have appreciated delving into some topics with a little more depth, just to see what microecon is really like.
@
Elisabeth Curtis
/course/859
A lot of people say that her tests are tricky but I feel like they are only tricky if you believe that and psych yourself out. If you calm down, think about the material and the problem sets and READ THE QUESTIONS CAREFULLY you'll be fine.  Curtis is a great prof and really responsive to questions. Do the problem sets! They're extremely helpful. Also-a lot of people from previous sections said that the problem sets are easier than the tests...and that's actually not true. They are about the same difficulty level and I think the only difference on the tests versus the problem sets is if you panic or not.  Study, go to the lectures, ask questions during office hours and do the problems in the back of the book and you'll be fine.   Take this course with Curtis! It's very interesting and it's actually made me interested in becoming an economics major even though I have never taken an econ course before.

Everyone knows about Curtis' great lecturing skills from the older SA Guide Reviews.  But as a student who expects only the best from a Dartmouth education, I will tell you that you will really have to see her to believe it.  Introductory Micro is generally a pretty dry subject, but Curtis definitely made the subject much more exciting with such lucid commentary unmatched by any of my Dartmouth professors thus far (save perhaps Professor Farid of COSC 4).  The homework was very fair, and very indicative of her midterms and final.  Curtis has a very particular style, which gets people EVERY time but you can walk into this class knowing EXACTLY what to expect.  She will basically take concepts already covered in class or (mostly) from the homework problem sets, and put some slightly more advanced variation of those concepts on the exams.  The median for the class is a B (sometimes a B-), but if you can catch on to her style early on, you will probably do well in this class.  I knew what Curtis was all about talking with upperclassmen and other freshmen who had taken the class with her...but you really have to get a feel for how she does things to really be able to do well here.  Good luck!

I initially struggled to get into econ 1 with prof Curtis (who had amazing reviews). Once enrolled though I realized quickly that not only did I learn far more about her children than I did about economics but that she was also unintelligent in addition to off topic. How this woman ended up teaching at Dartmouth is a mystery to me (apparently shes a visiting prof from Drexel?). After struggling through her painfully boring lectures I finally just decided to read the book. Upon doing so I was shocked to find out the material was actually interesting. Regardless, her tests did not reflect the material and were about twice as long as they should have been. I was forced to drop the class along with over 1/3 of the rest of my class due to her incompetence. Curtis belongs in an elementary school, avoid her at all costs.

She made a point of answering all questions in class and making herself available outside of class.

The class was good overall, and the tests reflected the homework in the short answer, but the multiple choice was hard. The tests were long and given in just one hour, and there wasn't really a way to prepare for the questions.  Prof. Curtis is very nice though, and she know's her stuff. She's helpful in office hours if you are confused and responds timely to e-mails as well.
@

/course/859
Curits is a great prof, explains the material thoroughly and makes sure to help you outside of class if necessary.  At times it seemed that we were tested more on speed however, as we were only given an hour for each of the midterms which makes it difficult to really think through the many multiple choice questions.  Try to devote a fair amount of time to the class, as it is an easy one to put off until right before a problem set or test.  My advice read ahead of time, and do one of the study groups through the academic skills center.

Curtis is a great prof.  She has a really organized lecture structure and waits until everyone understands the material before moving on.

Curtis is new but she was really on top of her game.  Her lectures were clear and well planned out, and her powerpoints allowed us to listen w/o scribbling down crazily.  It's a lot of material in a short period of time but if you do the prob sets and GO TO OFFICE HOURS (curtis is so helpful) you'll do great, and you'll learn that econ really isn't too bad.  Fair exams, though usually pressed for time.  If you want to take econ 1, take it w/ curtis.

Curtis lectures well, and is an overall good professor.   Homework is very useful for learning the material-if you can do and understand the problem sets, you'll do fine on the tests. Minimal studying goes a long way in this class.  Attendance is irrelevant. lecture notes are posted online, and the slides (on blackboard) follow the text closely. The only upside of class was her explanation of some of the trickier graphs.

This class was pretty much exactly what you would expect in Econ 1.  Not particularly exciting, but also not particularly difficult.  At the same time, don't count on an easy A.   There wasn't too much work, just weekly problem sets and 3 exams, including the final.  The lectures were all on powerpoint, and she basically just read off them, so it wasn't a big deal to miss class, though I didn't.  Curtis is a good lecturer, and is nice all around.  The material wasn't hard, and the tests weren't particularly difficult, but they were all WAY too long, so people didn't finish, and the grades were way lower than they should've been.

I learned a lot, but to be honest, this course is made so that only 'selected' students pass and not so that anyone LEARNS...  Whoever has done Econ before has no trouble and that's how the median end up being a B...people get either As or Ds...Fun, Fun, Fun...

Professor Curtis is really good.  The class is what it is.  Either you like the material or you don't...not much of a way around it...someparts are interesting, some parts are somewhat dull.

You could probably get away with not going to class and just reading the book and looking at the Blackboard powerpoints, but Professor Curtis adds a lot and is really god at explaining the material clearly.  I definitely recommend taking it with Curtis over any of the other Profs.

The title says it all, really...I'd never taken anything remotely related to econ before this class, but she made everything perfectly clear in her lectures, so once I got used to thinking like an economist, it wasn't a hard subject at all. She also did a really good job of making things seem relevant to the modern economy, and she had a great sense of humor, so it wasn't hard to pay attention or anything like that. The weekly problem sets (there are six, but she only counts the highest five) were tricky at times, and the first exam (there are two midterms) was brutal, but she ended up scaling it and the second exam was much better. If you have to take ECON 1 for your major or something, take it with Curtis!

Class was really interesting at first, but got kinda boring towards the end. Curtis is a great lecturer and the problem sets are easy, but that can be kinda tricky because she makes you feel like you understand the material, and you ace all these problem sets, but then you bomb her midterms because you have to apply the concepts different from any other way youve ever had to. Econ isnt interesting enough to just take if youre not a major or dont have to take the class as a prereq for another major, but if youre gonna take Econ 1, you might as well take it with her.

Professor Curtis is an amazing professor, she is really nice and gives effective lectures.  She is available after class where she gives very good explanations and answers to your question, more so than she is able to in class.  The material itself, and the tests were somewhat difficult, but if you keep up with the material and don't study at the last minute then its not so bad.

Professor Curtis was a great professor that really knew the topic well.  She cleared up all my questions and stuffed the information inside me.  Just an all around great teacher.  There are two midterms that count 20% each, problem sets that count 20%, and a final that is worth 40%.  For some, econ 1 is extremely difficult.  For others, it is really easy.  You either get the topic or you don't, and you'll find that out after the first test.  The tests are challenging, but you are prepared so well, it is easy to do well on them if you understand the concepts.  You won't get away with just memorizing the material.  You'll get a good idea of whether or not econ should be your major after taking this class.  The material is a little dry, but Curtis does her best to make it interesting. I learned a great deal, and I now want to pursue econ as a major because of Curtis.

I'm an ex-premed who hadn't taken any econ til senior year. By reports from friends who had taken Econ 1, I didn't know whether to look forward to this class or dread it. But taking it turned out to be one of the better decisions I've made at Dartmouth.   As far as I'm concerned, Professor Curtis is up there with the best lecturers at Dartmouth. She kept me engaged the entire time, even when the material was frankly not that interesting. She's also about the nicest and most personable professor you'll meet. Take advantage of her office hours (most people don't) - she is just excited to talk about econ with anyone that is interested in learning. Pay careful attention to details on answers in the problem sets and tests - you'll get nicked for a few points here and there on stupid mistakes.  Absolute joy of a class. And it's ECON 1!!

Material was a bit dry, by Prof. Curtis made the classes fun. Definitely recommend her for ECON 1 (because Giummo and Chang are nowhere close to her).  Curtis is extremely approachable. She is the exemplar of a Dartmouth professor. Brava!

Econ 1 with prof. Curtis has practically no work.  There are 6 problem sets throughout the term, each about 2 pages long.  They're incredibly easy.  She gives reasonably effective lectures, though towards the end of the term they took a precipitous drop in quality.  I would have actually preferred if the course had more problem sets, as it would have really helped with understanding the material.
@
Elisabeth Curtis
/course/859
Prof. Curtis is a great teacher. She makes the lectures interesting and is always available, either via blitz or during office hours, to answer students' questions. The material is fairly easy, as are the problem sets. The exams are difficult in that your time is limited, but she'll curve the grades, so you shouldn't worry.

A solid Intro course on Econ. I rarely had to read the text because Curtis's lectures were so good. The only thing I can complain about is that there wasn't enough time given on the Midterms, but other than that I enjoyed the class.

if you have to take econ1, take it with prof curtis. she is a great person and lecturer. her lectures are clear and inspiring. she is also very attentive to the students. she works really hard to help you learn the basics of microeconomics, and by the end of the term, you'll be thankful of her for it. i also heard that the other professors don't teach as well as prof. curtis. so take econ with prof. curtis!

professor curtis is very enthusiastic and a good lecturer, but the lectures themselves weren't all that interesting. the weekly problem sets helped when it came to learning the material, but the midterm and final exams were challenging.
@
Elisabeth Curtis
/course/859
The class was fairly interesting and was just a general introduction to economics. The two midterms had far too many questions in too short an amount of time and had some fairly difficult questions. Professor Curtis is available to help and will re-explain concepts in detail if needed. The lectures are just a powerpoint which are identical to the chapters in the textbook, so both going to class and doing the reading is really repetitive.

Professor Curtis is a wonderful lady who really knows how to teach intro micro. I thought this was an alright class, but I felt the exams could have been slightly easier. I feel the lectures and problem sets were not representative of the level we were expected to know on the exams.
@
Elisabeth Curtis
/course/859
The problem sets are usually pretty easy, especially because you can work with a friend, but the multipled choice section of the tests are really quite difficult. I felt that the material was not very hard, but sometimes she would make questions on the tests extra hard.  I feel that despite studying sufficiently for her tests, it was difficult to get a good grade on the multipe choice.  Otherwise, she's a decent teacher.
@

/course/859
Being an intro-level survey course, ECON 1 presents a challenge for professors.  They have to be creative enough to inspire continuing interest in the subjects but thorough enough to make sure students have their bases covered.  Curtis was successful at both.  She is very passionate about her subject, and she is incredibly accepting of in-class questions  She will immediately halt the lecture to address a raised hand, and she usually won't stop explaining until everyone understands.  The material in ECON 1 is inherently boring, but Curtis did her best to minimize it.  She was also very good at informing us of potential applications of the theories we learned, though I would have liked to see more emphasis on application.  Overall, good course, good prof.  It ain't exactly a blast, but it's a necessary first step if you want to go on in economics.
@
Elisabeth Curtis
/course/859
Econ 1 isn't the most exciting class, but Professor Curtis did what she could. She is very responsive to questions in class and outside of class, and her lectures are pretty well organized. She doesn't assign a lot of work either, but that doesn't mean this course is easy (her exams can be tough).
@
Elisabeth Curtis

Professor Curtis inspired interest in what i expected to be another boring intro class. she is very friendly and explained the material very well.  the weekly problem sets were not too difficult and helped prepare for the exams.  the test book was probably the best text book i've ever had for a class- it was easy and interesting to read, and really reinforced classwork.

professor curtis was excellent..she really helped learn the material and her lectures were effective and straightforward. good for econ 1
@
Elisabeth Curtis

Curtis is really nice, but lectures consisted mostly of her reading through the pre-made slides. I can do that on my own time, and I thought it was a waste of time. It felt a lot like high school.
@
Elisabeth Curtis
/course/859
On the whole, Econ 1 isn't that difficult - it's pretty basic economic theory, but it still takes some definite effort to understand all of the different concepts and somewhat complex graphs that you begin to learn about halfway through the course. Professor Curtis was excellent - while her lectures were all PowerPoint-based, she was extremely good and effective at explaning the notes on the slides and giving easy-to-understand, real-world examples of the information on the slides. For example, when talking about production, she would have us compare silly things like pizza and robots in order to understand how production within a country's economy might work. Beyond being an excellent teacher, she's simply the nicest person ever - she was always telling us about her kids, her life, etc., and she totally wanted to make sure that we understood everything she was teaching and that we felt comfortable with the material.  The problem sets weren't too bad - maybe 2 hours each, they got longer towards the end of the course. Furthermore, she was nice enough to drop the lowest grade out of the 6 sets, and you could always go to her office hours for help.  I can't recommend her enough! She's new to Dartmouth, and I hope she stays, because I couldn't have asked for a nicer, more understanding, more effective prof for the course.

Most people did not find this class very difficult at all. It's a great introduction to economics, for those who plan to major as well as those who don't. The material was fairly easy but it was also interesting, at least for those interested in the field. Professor Curtis was very nice and helpful, and gave good lectures, although most of the material can be learned from the textbook.
@
Elisabeth Curtis
/course/859
This is a good intro class, whether you are going to be an Econ major or not. The material is generally interesting, Prof. Curtis is really nice, and it's pretty easy. The class has two midterms and a final as well as a problem set each week. The problem sets are short and easy, and basically just pad your grade (she drops the lowest one). The midterms aren't bad, but the final is really long.   The lectures are actually pretty boring, as she post the powerpoints online before class and then doesn't deviate from them at all during class, which makes it dull if you already read the powerpoint (as she tells you to). Also, if you took any Econ in highschool, the first week or two will be repetative.
@
Elisabeth Curtis
/course/859
This is a fairly standard intro course. While it didn't particularly exceed my expectations, Prof. Curtis really helps by making sure everyone really understands the material and by being just a really nice person in general. I would really recommend going to office hours because she will basically tell you the answers to the problem sets. If you do well on the problem sets and pay attention in class, you should do well in the course. I was very surprised that the averages of our 2nd midterm and our final exam were as low as they were but I guess many students assumed they could still do ok even if they blew off the class. Not true! She also notices if you miss class...
@
Elisabeth Curtis
/course/859
Professor Curtis was not an original lecturer (she read her slides off of a screen), but her lectures definitely helped dissect and highlight the important parts of dense and dry material.  She may not make the classes that much more enjoyable to attend but her classes decrease time spent preparing problem sets and studying for tests alot.
@
Elisabeth Curtis
/course/859
Professor Curtis is incredibly nice and wants everyone in the class to do well. That said, the class started off really easy, then the homework and exams got progressively harder (but nothing too extreme). She lectures with powerpoint but makes you draw the graphs, which is pretty effective. She always said she was available for office hours. In addition to her teaching she's just a very nice person, in and out of class - great introductory class.

/course/859
I didn't exactly have high expectations for an Econ 1 class, but this actually turned into one of the interesting classes this term.  Here's how Prof. Curtis makes Intro to Econ material interesting and engaging  1- Classes in which we do case studies 2- We play "Games" in which the class breaks up into groups to answer questions (which helps to prepare us for the tests) 3- She's ALWAYS willing to meet with students in office hours and helps individuals who take the time to go there with problem sets and individual difficulties.    I initially signed up to take Econ 1 with Prof. Carrell, but (from what I've heard about Carrell's class) I was lucky to have Curtis.  She's engaging, and we understand the material in a non-convoluted manner.

Prof. Curtis is a great teacher; in her first term at Dartmouth she taught the class very well.  By providing lectures on Blackboard Curtis made class very easy to follow....She was also very accessible outside of class.  Although the material is easy, she taught it very effectively.

Professor Curtis does a great job teaching this intro course.  She is very approchable and an effective lecturer.

Overall, this is an excellent course and Prof Curtis helps make it that way.

The class provides an interesting insight into how individuals make decisions. I loved being able to approach the topic of choices from many different points of view -- from the consumer's point of view, from a competitive firm's point of view, from the game theory point of view (oligopolies).   Giummo himself is an interesting character. He definitely grew on me. Although he sort of drones during lectures and all his examples are framed in terms of beer and pizza, he has a sense of humor, and he is willing to answer questions. Although the two of us didn't always understand each other when I asked about a concept from lecture, he never objected to working through the confusion until I understood the concept.
@
Jesse Giummo
/course/859
I'll start out by saying i only went to 6 periods of class i think.  giummo's a very funny prof but he has a weird intonation that made it impossible for me to focus, if you get him you'll know what i'm talking about.  so if you're like me and don't go to class he makes available lots of materials for you study from online, the book is also pretty good.  the subject is stupid but necessary for higher level econ so i guess there isn't much to say, most people could guess the answers to a lot of questions just by common sense.
@
Jesse Giummo
/course/859
I was not really a big fan of this class.  I thought Giummo spent forever talking about nothing meaningful and then skipped over the important slides in about 30 seconds. There was basically no homework for the class, and the first exam was really easy, but the second and third were really tough--the problems were much more difficult than anything we had seen in class. However, Giummo is a really easy grader, and I ended up doing really well.  I strongly recommend going over the old exams that he posts, and doing so BEFORE the night before the exam, because they are the only real exposure you have to the kinds of questions on the exams. Overall, it was a really boring class, and I bet econ 1 probably always is, but Giummo is kind of an entertaining character so that makes it a little less painful.
@
Jesse Giummo
/course/859
Prof. Giummo might be the most amusing Prof I have ever met.  He is obsessed with colored chalk and makes his own sound effects when drawing diagrams on the board.  He brings fun food to his review sessions. He is also super personable and makes an effort to get to know his students.  That being said, his lectures are very very scattered.  He does post the power point slides he uses (mainly skipping through at rapid speeds) on blackboard which was hugely helpful when studying for exams.  He's also really really helpful during office hours.  I stopped reading the text book halfway through and did fine just using the slides.  The exams are tough, especially for non econ people like myself.  I think Giummo gets a bad rap sometimes but honestly I think he's probably just as good as any of the other Dartmouth profs who teach econ 1.
@

Only take this class if you need it! The material itself is a bit challenging and fast-paced. Prof. Giummo talks really fast, especially during important sections but his slides are really informative so definitely download them. He definitely tries to make lectures interesting and use examples you can relate to. He also does reviews for the midterms and finals, go to those!!
@

The prof was a really nice guy and funny at times, but lacked great teaching skills. I didn't think the material was that hard, but sometimes I could not understand his lectures because they were disorganized. The powerpoints were pretty good, though, and the tests were fair.
@

/course/859
This class I think will be a bit boring and tedious no matter whom you take it with.  Giummo does a fine job of explaining all of the concepts in class, and he provides all of the powerpoints of the lectures online, which is very helpful.  Additionally, he was always available during office hours, and provided practice tests from previous classes to help prepare us for the tests he gave, all of which were fair.
@
Jesse Giummo
/course/859
The lectures were often pretty dull (though Prof. Giummo is a nice guy), and most of the information covered wasn't really asked about on the exams except for on a few multiple choice questions.  The exams focused mostly on problems that only seemed possible from looking at past exams and their solutions.  Any new type of problem or twist on a previous problem often seemed to leave you guessing, as practice problems weren't done much in class.  The material itself wasn't uninteresting, but the class wasn't the best overall.

Giummo is a great guy when he's not teaching econ 1.  He tries to be funny in class, sometimes amusing students, but usually demonstrating how he doesn't really care about the subject material.  His classes are a joke but his slides were awesome and were my main source of information in this class.  I had not taken econ before and has to teach myself most of the class. I don't think I would take another class with Giummo unless I had to but would be interested to live a "day in the life" where basic elements of everyday life such as colored chalk and projector screens prove to be significant obstacles.

Professor Giummo is a really nice, hilarious guy, but his lectures are boring. Few students actually paid attention, and a significant number rarely went to class. However, he has really good slides that make it unnecessary to read the book. This is more of a teach-it-to-yourself class. Giummo is better than Chang, and the class isn't too hard. I wouldn't mind taking a class with Giummo again, although it wouldn't be my first choice of prof. It's not a terrible class and he's a good guy.
@
Jesse Giummo
/course/859
Professor Giummo is a really nice guy.  Really nice, however, does not mean good at explaining microeconomics.  He was easily distracted (by colored chalk, lawnmowers, stories about riding in stationwagons, rock paper scissors competitions, you name it) and, when actually lecturing (which was mostly straight from the powerpoints), peppered his speech with err and ummm and uhhh.  While his anecdotes were amusing, and his out-of-class research/job is cool, he's clearly not that interested in the material and fails to inspire interest.  I actually found myself unable to follow his lectures.   If you do have to take the class, just read his powerpoints, the book, and pay special attention to the graphs in the book.  His exams are mostly on graphs and charts.

Professor Giummo teaches his material very effectively. Also, his notes, which are available online, are so detailed that it is not always strictly necessary to attend the lectures.
@
Jesse Giummo
/course/859
Giummo's PowerPoint presentations were relatively thorough treatments of the subject material, but both these and Giummo's lectures were often full of typos and at times included erroneous and/or confusing statements.  Giummo was not a particularly engaging or enthusiastic lecturer.  Also, for the three major assessments (two midterms and final exam -- which together composed 90% of the final grade), the exam format consistently DEVIATED SUBSTANTIALLY from the professor's prior description of the test format for each exam.  The final exam turned out to be substantially more difficult than the past exams Giummo had made available for practice.  Overall, my experience in the class was mediocre, and that mediocre experience perhaps manifests itself in what turned out to be a mediocre grade in the course.
@
Jesse Giummo
/course/859
Prof Giummo is a nice guy, very easy going and you can see that he's trying very hard to help the students. However, he's not a prof that you can count on very much, due to the lack of experience and, some might say, clarity in his lecture.  However, it's good to be in his class if you are all about GPA. His tests are not hard and you are well prepared by his materials.
@
Jesse Giummo
/course/859
No.  I wouldn't recommend this course with Giummo.  Most of the questions on the test are hard to understand and, during the final, he changed like half of the test.
@
Jesse Giummo
/course/859
I'm sure anyone considering taking econ 1 knows what they're getting into - especially if they take it with Giummo.  Lectures are not boring per se, but what enjoyment can be derived from them is strickly from any off topic discussions or funny sugestions that the class makes (i.e. the material itself is not the interesting part). Expect the prof to make a bunch of mistakes when explaining key concepts, and expect to not catch them because you have drifted off. Reading the book is a good way to prepare for the multiple choice portions of tests (which are about half of problems); however, doing well on the assessments also depends on your ability to do mathematically-oriented questions of which you will have little solid preparation for. Going to review sessions is not really very helpful either, because as nice of a guy as Giummo is, you never actually do problems in the revew sessions, but rather listen as he lists the things you need to go figure out how to do. Anyway, your enjoyment of the course will likely be based on your facility with the subject, so if you think you'd be good at econ, go ahead and take the course, just don't expect anything groundbreaking.

I know a lot of people complain about econ 1, but my experience with this class was not that bad.  Giummo seems like a really nice guy, and he was great about answering questions outside of class, etc.  That said, Giummo was difficult in that his lectures and handwriting are really hard to follow... There's just something about his sentence structures and inflection that makes it really hard to stay focused on what he's trying to say... And his exams and notes were absolutely riddled with typos, which actually got really distracting.  In any case, I thought his exams were fair and the book was really really easy to read.  If you read the book, review his powerpoint presentations, and take his practice exams, you should definitely do ok.  The discussion board assignments were also surprisingly engaging at times.

Prof. Giummo meant well, but he often got confused by his own slides and trying to draw his own graphs.  The exams and midterms were really straightforward if you'd done the homework and gone over the past exams, so it was only really necessary to go to class about once a week.  All of the slides are posted on blackboard, so it's less confusing to read them on your own then to try to follow his train of thought.  Also, by using the past exams, homework, and blackboard slides, it made the textbook completely useless, so don't bother buying it.  It's exactly what you'd expect out of econ 1, so take it or leave it.
@
Jesse Giummo
/course/859
The title says it all. Giummo is a pretty average professor and the lectures are pretty average also. The book goes into far more detail than Giummo, so lectures were a lot more interesting when you didn't read before class. Overall the class was pretty easy. Although they aren't assigned, I would recommend doing the workbook questions because they don't take too long and are good preparation for the exam.
@

/course/859
Professor Giummo is a great guy, but not a great prof.  I always feel soo bad when I talk about what a bad prof he is because it is so hard to dislike him.  What makes him a below standards prof is that he does not explain things clearly.  He tends to ramble and even though he is very loud it is so easy to fall asleep. I took econ in high school and did extremely well so I had familiarity with the subject matter, and I still often found myself confused about something because of his vague explanations.  So the truth is, if you are thinking of becoming an econ major either don't take econ 1 with Giummo or get ready to learn a lot on your own.
@

This class would have been a joke in a high school or a community college, but this is an Ivy League School and to have a teacher this abysmal was a true insult.  Though I went to every class, I never managed to fully stay awake for an entire hour and five minutes.  Even so I tried to pay attention to his lectures but they left more confused than if I had ignored them completely.  When students would ask questions he would hardly be able to answer them.  Every homework and lecture had tons of typos and some true errors (once he wrote increase when he meant decrease and didn;t catch it till someone told him. Thats the type of thing that can make complicated material even more tricky) The only good thing was a clear textbook.  If you have to take this course, try to avoid Giummo.

Pretty much the standard Econ 1 course. The only problem I had with Giummo was the fact that he was a bit condescending towards the students...he kind of went through the motions in teaching the basics of economics. Tests were a bit random, but overall it was a standard Econ 1 class.

giummo's lectures are monotonous at best ... he intones his voice, and he doesn't read straight from his notes, so i actually haven't decided what makes them so boring.  he tends to repeat the same concept a few times while lecturing, so overall lectures are fairly boring and progress too slowly.  but they were well prepared and well-structured.  giummo is a very nice guy, and a new prof, so i have to give him some credit.  however, i think he would do much better in a higher-level industrial organization econ class, not the only introducion to economics class that dartmouth has to offer.  exams were moderatly difficult, but too generously curved.    if you're looking to be an econ major, i doubt i learned enough in the class to prepare me well for econ 21 or 22, although i did very well in the class.  on the other hand, if you're looking for a low-stress introduction to how economics works, this is a decent course

not that interesting, but the knowledge you gain is pretty useful.    giummo knows his stuff, but isn't the greatest lecturer...he often babbles about stuff that is interesting but not really that pertinent to the material.  not that many people went to class from what i gathered.  if you did the reading, the lectures were not really necessary.

Personally, I really enjoyed learning the material for Econ 1.  But you must learn pretty much everything by yourself because the lectures are terrible and boring.  Prof. Giummo is a cool guy, but he is not a good teacher. The only plus of this class is that it is easy.    Take Econ 1 with Bentz.

I enjoyed this class, partly because I found the material interesting and partly because it didn't require a lot of work. The only part of the class that was really difficult was the final exam. Professor Giummo put a lot of effort into teaching the class, but he has a tendency to make material a little more confusing than it need be. However, the textbook does a good job explaining the material anyway. Overall, I am glad that I took this course.
@

Professor is a good guy and is very accessible and tries extremely hard to help.  But unfortunately, he does not know how to explain things in a coherent or simple, easy-to-understand manner.  He just needs a little more experience and in a few years, he'll become a better professor.
@

Everything can be learned from the slides. Although there are mistakes in many of his slides. He knows the material but has difficulty communicating it. The tests aren't difficult but I felt I was missing out on material that I'll need for later courses.

Beware! If you take this course, you definitely want to avoid Giummo unless you're just looking for a relatively easy course. After the first exam, I realized that I could simply read the text and skip class, and I would do just as well (if not better, for lack of his confusing lectures). 80-90% of what I learned from this course I learned simply by reading the text. His lectures, despite specifically addressing the exams to a greater degree than the text, are relatively worthless.
@
Jesse Giummo
/course/859
I think Giummo is an okay professor but he makes lots of mistakes when he talks and you can catch those mistakes but sometimes you can and his lectures can actually confuse you when you are studying or taking a test. The final was challenging simply because he doesn't really teach the material he just summarizes the book. If you read the book and understand it on your own, you will do well in the course. He doesn't give problem sets so the studying is all up to you.

"Principles of Microeconomics," the textbook assigned, is awesome. I daresay I learned more from the textbook than from the professor. Giummo's SUCH a nice guy, and he tries hard, but he's really disorganized. The class makes extensive use of Blackboard, and the discussion board assignments are interesting. The tests are just right and the fact that Giummo CURVES 'EM LIKE CRAZY is even better.

First understand that I am most definitely not the type of person who just skips class regularly.  But this guy was honestly the worst professor I have ever encountered - a nice guy no doubt, but wow! I could actually feel myself getting stupider and stupider the longer I stayed in class. I felt like I should almost be offended that someone would give him a position at a college like Dartmouth.  I should have been warned when I saw a previous review of him that said he "couldn't teach his way out of a paper bag."  - That doesn't begin to explain it. . . I only took the class because I absolutely had to for my major, and spent the least amount of time possible on it - because even reading his power point lectures was like an insult - NO command of spelling, grammar or sentance structure.  It was like a riddle trying to read a lecture. But you know, besides that ... at least it gave me a whole extra hour and 5 minutes three times a week  ) bottom line AVOID GUIMMO
@
Jesse Giummo
/course/859
This teacher is completely ineffective, uninspiring and is a very poor example of the type of academic/teaching standard this college should have. His inability to convey the simplest of concepts without screwing up the details, combined with his constant off topic banter made for of of the most pointless and painful experiences i have ever had in my life.   Econ 1 itself is a very large (though basic) topic, and wading through the waters with this guy is miserable at times. I sympathize with all of the majors who have to take this course, but if at all possible - avoid this professor, and expect to do most of the learning independantly through textbook readings and his amazingly illegible powerpoint slides.

I thought this was one of the easiest classes I have taken here at Dartmouth.  There were really no surprises; the material was intuitive for me.  Weighing costs and benefits to find the optimal choice makes sense to me.  The course involved very little work outside outside of class.  I found class much more helpful than the textbook because the examples helped me to learn the material and applications.  Professor Giummo can be a little scatterbrianed at times, but he knows his stuff and is helpful and tries very hard.  He can laugh at himself, and isn't another pompous Dartmouth professor.  Outside of class he is very approachable.

@

/course/859
Prof. Giummo is a great guy and tries really hard, but tends to ramble and give unnecessarily elaborate examples.  But his tests are easy and the material is too, so I would recommend taking it with him because you don't need an amazing lecturer for an intro course.  He makes the class humorous and loves his students (he brought brownies to class once, and got donuts for our study session when someone jokingly requested them).
@
Jesse Giummo
/course/859
The course itself is pretty bland -- it's the intro course to Economics, so a lot of what's covered seems like complete common sense (even when you haven't taken Econ before).   Prof. Giummo is a great guy -- he's really responsive to students and really tries to make the class interesting and fun. His slides are really organized. However... he's a really confusing lecturer. He often confuses himself, and has a bad sense of how much time to spend on certain subjects.   The class is really easy until the tests come. Either you'll do really well because they're pretty straightforward (and he posts old exams that are almost identical), or you'll have issues cause you'll get confused.   Basically, this class is really easy to do well in, but you have to either have an innate sense of the basics of Econ or figure everything out on your own. The latter isn't awful to do, because the book is good, and there's a study guide, and as I said, he posts old exams and the right answers.   As for Prof. Giummo, he's really trying, so I think he'll get better (this fall was only the second time he taught the class).

Min Chang's lectures are horrible. She cannot make a coherent point for her life. She never once gave a clear explanation for anything. She is absolutely no help in understanding economics. I feel completely unprepared for future econ courses, and also am completely turned off from the field of economics.  Don't try asking questions in class, because she either interprets questions as criticism or rambles about an unrelated subject. Also, she started giving weekly quizzes instead of problem sets in addition to having a "closed notes" policy in class. So you can't even take notes on her lectures.  I took this course even though I heard that Chang was terrible because I thought it couldn't be that bad. IT IS THAT BAD.
@
Min Chang
/course/859
Basic intro class.  Fairly easy if you follow lectures though it's difficult since the prof does little to inspire interest.  Her exams reflect the lectures exactly.  Do the practice exams, review 20 min a day, and you can expect an A.  However, the lectures themselves show lack of creativity.  She's not the type of professor you want to challenge...she has difficulty clarifying her position.

Take Econ 1 with Min Chang only if you really need to take the course and if you can study the material by yourself effectively, which was my case.

Econ 1, I had heard, was the most interesting of the econ classes if you had no interest for the subject. I gave it a try, having taken the macro AP. The subject material was actually interesting to me, and wasn't too difficult. But the professor made the class worse than it could have been. After you get past her accent, she still does not answer (or side-steps) perfectly legitimate questions from the students. When the question is pressed, she becomes slightly belligerent and defensive.
@
Min Chang
/course/859
The material is interesting. But Prof. Chang makes is so awful.   The classes didn't correspond to the assigned reading.  The tests were hard and vague.  The focus of the test seemed to be to trick the students rather than effectively test us. There wasn't enough time for all questions on the test. Small questions had huge points meaning if you missed them you were screwed. She takes  points  off for little things and then refuses to even discuss why she took them off.  Overall, an awful experience. Save yourself the trouble and don't take it with Chang. Especially to incoming freshman, I was naive and took it with Chang anyway. You guys should save yourself.
@

This class is a complete nightmare. The homework isn't that hard, the book is pretty straightforward, but Min Chang is horrible! Her lectures usually have nothing to do with the previous reading, and if it does, she makes it much more confusing than it has to be.  I understood every topic, but the tests are very difficult and vague and it doesn't effectively test your knowledge of the subject.  I know what you may be thinking "It couldn't be that hard of a class, I can deal with it." NO. I thought the same way and I regret it.  Save yourself the pain and wait to take it the next quarter with another prof unless for some reason there is no other way, please.
@
Min Chang
/course/859
Coming to Dartmouth College I expected a much higher quality class than this.  I am appalled, as I did not even have a class in high school as poorly taught as this.  The professor does not have a sure footing in the material and every class is a jumble of random notes on information, often contradicting itself.  The only way to pass this class is to 1) read the book, 2) join a study group (she gives the answers to her subjective problem sets to the group leaders), and 3) sit in the front row, otherwise she will never know your name and thus you will not get participation points.   	I read the reviews for this class and thought that it would be manageable, and it is, if you carry out the above-mentioned steps.  However, it is not worth you time to take this class.  The information taught by the other professors is different than her information (while the other professors have similar content), so if you have the chance, take this with another professor, especially since if you plan on continuing in economics, the information you learn in this class is only partially relevant.  I am discouraged from taking more courses in the economics department due to the poor experience I have had, and I will be severely disappointed if I have any other classes of this low caliber.

First, the office hours were unhelpful in terms of getting help with the problem sets. Professor Chang was unable to answer questions succinctly in class and while going over the problem sets didn't seem to know the correct answer sometimes. Although I felt like we covered and learned the concepts in the book, there were times that she contradicted the book and simply said don't worry about it.  Also, in office hours I struggled to have her explain concepts in a different way.  She also was rather 'unhuman' in class. No hellos in the mornings or many interactions besides for the concepts and material.  However, she was more personable in office hours.
@
Min Chang
/course/859
The book was sort of interesting, albeit really really slow.  The material is an informative introduction to Econ.  The one really really big downside is the prof.  You get used to her accent after a little while, but the fact remains that she really has no idea.  Her test questions are ambiguous and often incorrect.  Listening to her speak is much less effective than just reading the book in class.  That said - SUPER EASY CLASS.

Min Chang is a terrible prof, just look here at course guide, she has 3 years of consistently terrible reviews. Sometimes hard to understand her English, always hard to understand her lectures. I frequently left class after a lecture about a reading more confused than I was when I had just done the reading. Problem sets have a few tricky questions but aren't too bad. First exam and final are pretty easy, second midterm is very hard. There are plenty of profs teaching econ 1, its not a bad course, just take it with someone else--anyone else!
@

The material is super easy, the book is SO easy to read, and homeworks are an easy 100% if you work with a study group  And the exams are not bad either (I never studied until the day before).  That being said, I personally don't have much to complain about.  I'm actually surprised because Curtis's students complain that the material is hard, yet the prof is good, while Min's students complain the prof is bad but the material is easy.  (does that make sense to you??)  Well, I guess the reason I don't have any complaints is that this course was by far the EASIEST of my 3, AND the LEAST time consuming.  And before even taking this course with Min, I had read the previous reviews and mentally prepared myself.  So I basically bit my lip, expecting the worst of all nightmares, and trudged through this term--and then I realized it's not so bad.

Min Chang is downright a terrible teacher.  From her poor command of the english language, her sloppily written tests and problems sets, to her lack of organization, this class was not a success.  Yes, I did learn the basics of economics in this class, through a careful reading of the text book on my own and as a consequence I did quite well in the course.  I could have done just as well on the exams though, had I never attended a single class.  About the only positive thing about this class is that through the work on the problem sets, I developed some of my better friends at dartmouth.
@
Min Chang

The prof was a bit difficult to understand at times, but she explained the material well for the most part and brought in outside examples to help us understand the concepts.  The exams were fair, but she was extremely picky in grading the problem sets.
@
Min Chang
/course/859
Okay. So, the class size wasn't too bad. Somewhere in the mid-30s. We had six homework assignments, five of which were graded (mostly in class). Two mid-terms, and the final. She would randomly pass around attendance (she did this twice), and and the very end of the course she took note of who spoke in class.   The prof would sometimes have problems answering questions. Several times during the term she would write on the board, maybe drawing a graph... and just sit still, frozen... unable to continue. Then, she's just erase the board and just go onto to something else (or the class would end).   The homework assignments weren't too bad. If you sign up for a study group through the academic skills center, you'll do swell.  The mid-terms weren't curved, and you pretty much had no clue how you were doing. But the median ending up being a B+ (higher than the other sections, at a B).    Mixed reviews... we learn in the class... but she's pretty stoic. When people would come in late she would single them out.  Econ 1 was pretty interesting... but this is in spite of Prof. Min Chang. I did like how we pretty much covered the whole book (I think we only skipped two chapters.) So, ehh.

@
Min Chang

I recommend using the book to follow along with Professor Ming's lectures. She uses powerpoints that come with the textbook so the material covered on exams can be found and reviewed by doing the reading. She is a really sweet woman and wants students to do well, though at times her lectures are less than effective. She doesn't really make the material exciting, gets confused in class sometimes, and needs to have greater confidence to control the class. But she is always available for office hours and is responsive to students in class when there are questions on the material. She genuinely wants sudents to understand everything that happens in class. This is my first econ class so I don't have much to compare it to, but it seemed like a straight forward intro into economics. It could have been a more dynamic class, but it could have very well been a lot more confusing, too.

after hearing bad things about her, i originally thought min chang was a decent prof who just had trouble because her english isnt great.  in actuality, this isnt true as she doesnt have a great grasp of the material, isnt good at explaining, and often confuses herself in class.  plus, she puts questions on the exams that she often cant explain or gets wrong when she tries to do them, which i found pretty unfair.  ive learned more in two econ 22 lectures this term than i learned from her all of last term

Min Chang might just be the worst professor in the economics department. She made an easy topic like econ confusing. From the very beginning, she had very little control of the class, and although she tried to answer questions posed by student, she couldn't cogently answer most of them. Her lectures consisted of her simply reciting the powerpoint presentation( which is already provided on blackboard) without adding any substantial or interesting information afterwards. Her english is indecipherable, which only made the class worse. Only have this professor as an absolute last resort.
@
Min Chang
/course/859
i felt surrounded by right-wing freshmen who couldn't do math. they constantly bombarded the professor with rude questions, which is apparently the norm in the econ department.   the subject matter avoids any real math, which doesn't make any sense becuase math describes all the models. the department is  basically just trying to avoid scaring off freshmen with the actual calculations necessary to understand this stuff, and hence has developed this watered-down course, but frankly the class would do well if it lost some of the folks who were only in it looking to sell themselves to corporations a few years down the line.  min chang is a very good instructor with a natural talent for explaination, but unfortunately this is somewhat mitigated by her english, which is not very good. she is very helpful in catching students up, however.  i ended up skipping a lot of classes as there was no attendance taken and i couldn't stand to see people picking on her the way they did.

This was Min Chang's first term at Dartmouth and it showed. She tried to be responsive, but she didn't always seem to understand the material herself.  Her accent made it kind of hard to understand her.  Most of the students don't go to class, and if you do the readings and read the slide, then you can do fine on the exams.  There are weekly assignments that aren't really complex, but they take awhile if you don't do the reading beforehand.

I honestly can't understand how this professor got a job at this school. Not only is her English difficult to understand, but she has a vague grasp of the material at best.

Less than half the class is present on any given day. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH MIN CHANG!!

Econ 1 is obviously a pre-req for the econ major, BUT DO NOT take it with Min Chang. Her explanations are horrible, and only serve to confuse the class more.

I took the class because I want to be an econ major, and while it isn't necessarily fun, what you learn is worthwhile.  It was not much work but the tests were hard. Also, attendance is somewhat optional because the class is taught by powerpoint, which is posted on blackboard.
@

people complain a lot about this prof and class. but after all, i think it was mostly due to their inadequecy. the prof is new so she had times when she was really all over the place and english isnt her first languagem so sometimes she had to explain things in roundabout ways. however, she helps you a lot if you visit during office hours. econ in general is a harder subject  and many people just take the class because it's cool to say that they're econ majors and just get frustrated when they cant understand the challenging concepts. this class is a typical intro "weeder " class. so the prof. may be not as good as the higher level courses, but she's not too bad. just read your book and dont be inherently stupid.

Patricia Anderson knows/has knowledge in the field of economics, thats why she is at Dartmouth. But, as a professor, she sucks. It was clear that she really did not want to teach this course. It was not a good experience. Would not recommend. Take it with someone else. Econ 1 is hard indeed, but she makes it harder, as she is such a bad porf. The grades is heavily based on exams, and most of it, or almost 2/3rd is multiple choice(MC). MCs make your life hell, get one wrong, and that 3 points off. Not an active discussion class. Boring lectures. Takes the fun of economics from economics.
@
Patricia Anderson
/course/859
I respect Anderson, she clearly knows her stuff. However, she doesn't really care about either undergrads or intro courses. The lectures had cool material, but she didn't really made it enjoyable. No matter how much you study in her class, you will probably end up with a B/B+. Her exams are just tricky on words, and you will pretty much use every minute of given time. Other teachers have stricter grade margins, but easier exams.  Nevertheless, take the class because some things you will learn are essential. Youtube and Jacob Clifford will be your best friends.
@

Professor Anderson was great. She knew the material and was actually funny at times during her lectures. The workload was light, but significant preparation is needed before midterms and the final. Overall, not an easy class, but no Econ 1 course will be. That being said, I would recommend Professor Anderson.
@
Patricia Anderson
/course/859
Prof. Anderson is really nice and knows her stuff, but it is pretty clear that freshman Econ classes are not her top priority. The lectures are pretty dry and there is relatively little class engagement. Most of the class had already taken Econ in high school so I was a bit overwhelmed at times but the material isn't too difficult. Anderson's tests are much more difficult than other professors though as kids from other classes never understood how to do the problem sets we had. There is relatively little work in this class (6 short problem sets, 2 midterms and a final) but if you don't take the work seriously and review throughout the term the final and midterms will prove difficult.
@
Patricia Anderson
/course/859
Kind of a dull class; Professor Anderson was assigned Econ 1 shortly before the start of the term and, while she was prepared for the class, it is clear that introductory economics was not her first choice class to teach. That said, if lecture style classes suite you, econ 1 with Anderson shouldn't be too bad. The class is pretty easy if you have a background in economics (i.e. took AP econ in high school), and the workload is deceptively light (I think the hour-max problem sets every two weeks threw a lot of people off, since there wasn't any other mandated review). Tests are very fair, and similar to the practice exams she puts online.
@
Patricia Anderson
/course/859
I know it's not a popular opinion, but I thought Anderson was great. She knows her stuff and keeps it interesting with her dry humor. Plus she is the most organized teacher I've ever had. Canvas is loaded with powerpoints and practice tests that are super useful. It's a lecture style class and she does lots of examples, but you can prepare however little or much you want. Midterms were hard and required a lot of preparation, but she's a fair grader. It may be rough if you have never taken Econ, but not impossible. Overall, I would recommend the class and the prof.
@
Patricia Anderson
/course/859
Anderson is definitely experienced and knows her stuff really well. She isn't particularly the most interesting prof around, but if you make it a point to be in class and pay attention to her derivations of graphs etc, you'll have no problem understanding the content. If you've done econ before, I'm sure this is an easy class. I've never done Econ before, and this was an easy class. Did it in a 4-class term, and wasn't much extra work.

While this wasn't the most exciting class I've taken, I wouldn't say it was bad in any way.  It's a pretty standard intro. style course with lots of general material.    Professor Anderson is a little boring to listen to, but she gets the job done.  basically goes over her powerpoint slides (posted on blackboard), so its easy to catch up if you miss a class.

Considering the fact that Prof Anderson was the only permanent faculty teaching Econ 1, this course was as interesting as Econ 1 gets. The tests are fair and the problem sets are excellent ways to prepare for these. Also, Prof Anderson gives her class practice exams from old terms and this helps as well.
@

I stopped going to class because she was so bad.  She knows what she is talking about, but she is a very dry lecturer and can put even the most studious and dedicated students to sleep.  I found that I did better by not going to class and just reading the textbook chapters during the scheduled class time, and I'm stil getting a good grade.
@
Patricia Anderson
/course/859
Overall this was not an interesting class at all.  Prof. Anderson was nice, and tried to make the subject interesting.  Unfortunately this is pretty much impossible because econ 1 is the most boring subject ever and there is very little point to it unless you want to be an econ major...

I went to the first few classes taught by both Bentz and Anderson, but got stuck with Anderson.  She knows the material but is lazy and teaches right off of the book's slides.  Also, it feels a lot like a high school class.  Get Bentz if you can.

The problem sets were graded quite strictly; however, overall grades were fair.
@

The Prof is monotone, though she does cover the material very well. If you can sit through the class without drooling over the table (something I couldn't do), then you'd be fine. Many test questions are from the lecture and the slides, but I'd read the book too if I were you. Btw, don't slack off on the first midterm, cuz it's gonna come back and bite you hard.

The subject is intersting, the material is not horribly difficult but it was difficult to learn because of the pace of the course. Also, sometimes it was difficult keeping focus.
@
Patricia Anderson
/course/859
Professor Anderson means well, but she does little to inspire interest in a monotonous course.  Power point lectures straight from the book, so there is no motivation to attend, or pay attention.  Overall, it is a much easier course I am sure if you attend and pay attention, but without doing that it is doable.
@
Patricia Anderson
/course/859
professor anderson was so insanely boring, i suggest sitting in the front.  of the few people who attended classes, people were doodling, dozing, and dummying themselves.  the homework was graded sort of arbitrarily, the tests were short, but the time limit made it tough to work through.
@
Patricia Anderson
/course/859
The class was boring because of the professor.  I often slept during class because the professor bored me.  Her examples were boring.  Some better thought out ORIGINAL examples would be better.  My high school econ teacher was MUCH better than this professor.  For possible econ majors if you end up with this professor, do not AT ALL judge the major on this.  Transfer to another Econ 1 class or just take another class instead.
@
Patricia Anderson
/course/859
Prof Anderson knows her stuff. It's evident if you ask her a question or just go to her office hours. She's a great prof except that during lectures she just drones on about the subject and it sounds like she doesn't have any enthusiasm for it. But she does throw in a few jokes that are hilarious if you are paying attention.  The lectures are just the slides that she posts on blackboard so you don't necessarily need to go to lecture, but it's good because she explains them.  The book is really important to understand the material and helps more than the slides with the problem sets that are due every week.  The exams are a fair assessement of the material learned.  Provides a good basis of microeconomics and is interesting stuff, but boring class to go to.
@
Patricia Anderson
/course/859
If econ is your thing than not only do you need to take this but you would probably enjoy it.  Prof. Anderson though is not the one to take it with, she is boring.  You can decide to either go to class or do the readings, either way you'll end up in the same place because all class is is going over the readings.  (that is she uses pointpoint slides right out of the textbook and just scrolls through them).  This, although boring, does make for a pretty light course load, so if you're looking for an easy grade take it with her, I hear Bentz is much harder.
@
Patricia Anderson
/course/859
Professor Anderson was excellent! She was well organized and clear in her lectures, and was able to answer questions well.  Her examples were practical and interesting.  This is pretty basic material, but she made it interesting.  Her tests are very similar to the problem sets and lectures.  If you pay attention in class, this class requires very little studying.
@
Patricia Anderson
/course/859
Do the readings for this class.  If you read the book, you don't really need to go to class...  The class was fairly boring.  However, the book was very interesting, and taught the material very well.  If you get econ and math, you will do fine.  However, some people have a lot of trouble with this class.  Econ seems to be one of those things that you either get or you don't.  Don't be afraid to ask other kids in the class for help on the problem sets.  There is at least one econ genius in every intro class.
@
Patricia Anderson
/course/859
ECON 1....well you have to take it to be a major.   Prof. Anderson is a pretty good teacher, class is kind of mundane, but it's econ 1 material, so you can't expect too much. She does try to enliven the class with dry humor once in awhile.   Tests in this class are challenging, but a good assessment of the material. If you understand the material, you should be fine.  Prof. Anderson is a good prof and is available outside of class if you need help.   Take it....

Read the textbook. Do the Problem sets with a friend and it helps.
@
Patricia Anderson
/course/859
The course consisted of a series of powerpoint lectures, which are not the most interesting, but has the advantage that students can access the lectures online.  Prof Anderson had a dry sense of humor, but her monotonous voice does tend to send quite a few people to sleep.  However, if you manage to stay awake, her explanations and examples do help you a lot in understanding the material.  You can choose to spend as much or as little time outside of class as you wish, as the problem sets are short and easy, and there's little other required work.  If you put in a decent effort and make sure you understand the key concepts (understanding the graphs is key, and remember that everything depends on marginal analysis), you'll do fine on the tests.
@
Patricia Anderson
/course/859
Econ 1 is a basic intro course to microeconomic principles.  Be warned that if you are not interested in taking any more economics courses, Econ 2 might be the course for you (its similar material, but without any math)  Unlike many of my classmates, I attended all of the classes--I learn better by being taught than by teaching myself through a textbook.  That being said, as long as you do the reading, Professor Anderson offers little incentive to attend class.  Her lectures are cut and dry slideshows of the graphs and bulleted points from the textbook (as in actually, from the textbook website!)  While Anderson might not be inspiring, at least her exams are straightforward--you know what to expect from doing the practice problems and the helpful book website practice tests (Bentz, on the other hand, likes to make his tests tricky!)

I was considering econ as a possible major or minor at the beginning of this class, but now I know it's not the subject for me. Anderson's course is very micro focused, and the lectures are slow, boring, and ineffective. She's a really nice person and always available and has consistent office hours, but this is by far one of the worst courses I have taken. It was a little easier for kids who were really interested and had taken econ in high school-- it's not a phenomenal amount of work, but it gets frustrating if it doesn't come as easily to you.
@
Patricia Anderson
/course/859
My problem with Professor Anderson was that she seemed to know that many of the students in the class were just taking it for the distrib. credit and had virtually no interest in what she was talking about, so she tended to hurry through the material, not really trying to make it interesting or pertinent. Granted, she sometimes made an effort with a quirky example or a deadpan sort of joke. But generally she seemed to just sort of let our complacency dictate her teaching style. Bugs me when professors seem to lack enthusiasm for their subject.  Still, everyone should learn at least some of the material covered in this class, econ major or not. It's just good knowledge to have.
@
Patricia Anderson
/course/859
Prof. Anderson takes powerpoints directly from those supplied with the book.  She goes throught them effectively, even adding some extra insights, but if you read the book you realize that she takes these from the text as well.  Possibly too basic of a course to expect much effort from a prof, but you could pass in flying colors without setting foot in class.

Econ 1 was extremely easy.  Not that interesting.  I'd recommend it only to folks who need to take it for another class.  Carrel was good, although he doesn't teach at dartmouth anymore.
@

/course/859
I'm only filling out this courseguide review to try to win EBAs from SA.  Carrell is gone, so this review probably isn't that helpful anymore.  I will say that I think econ 1 is a course that everyone should take because it will give you (or reinforce) a new and improved way to look at the world and decision making.
@

It's too bad Carrell is leaving because he's a great guy. This is standard econ one, you know what to expect, and you cant take the class with Carrell anymore, so start reading other reviews and decide who you want to take it with. A good prof is crucial
@

/course/859
The class isn't bad, but I did think it was difficult.  I was really excited about Econ at first "Oh! The price system! cool! I'll know about markets and pricing and it'll be great!" The readings from the book weren't bad, and I didn't mind them.  Even the lectures were tolerable, though I was in the 845 AM section, which was rough at times.  The problem I had was with the tests...I just couldn't quite seem to do as well as I expected.  Professor Carrell is a really nice guy, and he was helpful during office hours.

Scott Carrell is great, but unfortunately this was his last term at Dartmouth.  So anything else I say probably won't be of much use.  But definitely take Econ 1 if you're considering it, it's good stuff.
@

/course/859
This class is really hard for some people and really easy for others. If you're in the latter group, it's really no work at all.   But I did see a lot of kids drop out of the class.  I suggest doing additional econ readings if you find it boring. They can really inspire more interest in the subject. Carrell has some good links from blackboard. Check out Mankiw's blog.
@
Scott E.
/course/859
I have heard some ECON 1 horror stories, but this clas wasn't that bad at all. Carrell is a brand-new prof, young and in touch with students and a generally great guy. His teaching background makes him well suited to lecture and make even this intro course interesting (ask him about his college/Air Force days). I really liked the fact he wrote up interesting practice problems for us.  Since you probably have to take ECON 1 at some time (or should), try to get Carrell.
@
Scott E.
/course/859
This was Professor Carrell's first term teaching at Dartmouth and he got better as the term progressed; he asked for feedback around midterm and made some of the changes that we suggested. Every class is a powerpoint of stuff that is mostly straight from the book. Econ1 is a good class to take in general; though much of it is common sense/logic, there is still a lot to learn (especially terminology that will be useful to know later in life). Problem sets weren't bad. The first test was easy, the second was a time crunch and made up for the first.
@
Scott E.
/course/859
Regardless of whether you are a major or not (I certainly am not) this stuff is really valuable to know and introduced me to a whole new way of thinking. The cost-benefit analysis can be applied to almost any situation even the most intangible subjects, and the professor, slides, and book are all really clear and easy to understand.  There is every support in place for you to succeed in this class and to learn a lot.  You will.  Take this class.

If given a choice, try to take Econ 1 with Professor Carrell.  This class was a 9L, but it was worth it.  He is very engaging, and has great stories and anecdotes to tell, ranging from his days at the Air Force Academy (teaching and attending) to research he has done on a variety of subjects.  He has a great sense of humor too.  His lectures are pretty much taken straight from the book, and he posts the slides online as well.  The practice problems are hard enough to be helpful, but not so difficult that you can't do well enough to boost your grade a little.  Our first midterm was the first test he had ever written, and it was way too easy, but the second one brought the median grade down.  However, it was a fair test, and most topics had been either discussed in class, or were at least on his slides.  He also explains topics quite well one on one during office hours, so if you don't understand a concept, be sure to stop by and ask.

I don't really like economics at all, and find it rather boring. I'm a sciences person--but Prof Carrell is great. He's young and unjaded toward teaching, enthusiastic, and totally not your typical Dartmouth prof. Ex-Naval Academy guy--lectures to the *whole* room if you know what I mean. Definitely not afraid to call students down who are out of line either--Fave moment was when some very talkative jock called  environmentalists hippies and prof Carrell totally stomped on him. "That's not called for." It's nice to see a very masculine guy prof not just automatically laugh and side with the jocks.
@
Scott E.
/course/859
Professor Carrell is a really really nice guy. He tells lots of stories and tries to make his early morning lectures interesting and effective. The class is not well-paced. The beginning, easier material was taught too slowly and dragged, but by the end of the class, I felt like he was trying to stuff way too much into too little time. The tests are very long, and usually much harder than the problem sets or practice problems. If the pacing were changed I think the course could be a lot better.
@
Scott E.
/course/859
I was really glad I took this course. It has helped me to think about many things in a way I never have before and I am now looking forward to taking more classes in the Econ department. Of course, I've heard that there are many econ 1 teachers who suck, so I feel I'm lucky to have gotten Carrell. He lectured well and I hardly had to study beyond doing the assigned homeworks. That said, you definitely should do those. If you are able to figure them out, then you really don't need to read the book. He posts chapeter summaries on blackboard and those were enough for me to be prepared for the lecture each day.
@

If your not going to be an Econ major, or you don't need it to fill any major distrib, I wouldn't take it. It was really interesting at first, then dropped off hard and was ridiculously boring towards the last half of the class. The professor is a good guy though and he teaches it pretty well.

@

Carrell tries to teach this class to make you understand economic principles in order to analyze real world problems. That sounds a little boring, but the material is so practical and it is exciting when you're doing problems and you realize that you don't care about your grade, all you care about is getting to an answer that makes sense. Professor Carrell, I think, is the toughest Econ 1 prof (I know I went in underestimating the difficulty of the class), but you'll definitely get the most out of it.
@
Scott E.
/course/859
Carrell is a great professor for this course, unlike all the horror stories that I'm sure you've heard about other Econ 1 profs that barely can speak English. He's articulate, intelligent, and fair with regard to grades. Beyond that, I would say that if you're looking for a SOC distrib, you should take this course (that's why I took it). After taking the course, I feel that everyone should take an introductory econ course. It dispells a lot of seemingly common sense notions about how markets work and you gain a lot of useful knowledge with regard to your civic duties (vote intelligently). Sweet course.
@
Scott E.
/course/859
My thoughts about Econ 1 the class -You should take Econ 1.  If nothing else, it will teach you about a worthwhile way to think (MC=MB) which can be applied to all aspects of life. Literally, all aspects. -The class isn't easy, but if you do the work, you can do well.  There is very little memorization.  If you expect to come in and memorize the textbook, like in Biology, and do well, you will be disappointed.  I'm not sure if I flat-out memorized anything in the course.  It is all about understanding concepts and applying to concepts.   -I took it freshman fall, and I thought it was a great course to take.  Not too much work, but you can't slack off either. This isn't one of those abstract classes either.  I came out of this with useful knowledge. -From what I saw, there are basically two ways to do well in the course.  1) Go to every lecture, follow along the powerpoint slides, take notes, absorb the material from there.  2)Skip classes, read the book.  I choose 1, but because the each lecture basically covers one chapter of the book, either one will work.  You should pick 1 too though because Carrell is such a good lecturer and intelligent guy that it is well worth your time to go to class.   About Carrell -Though you can learn all the material from the book, I would recommend going to every class because he is a great lecturer.  Very well-spoken. -He is extremely intelligent.   -I got the impression he wanted to go beyond the more basic overview of some topics because he knew more about it and really liked that particular topic, but because of time constraints had to restrain himself.  That's neither a positive or negative really, just an observation. -He has experienced the world (he was in the Air Force for about a decade) so he isn't one of these Ivory tower sheltered professors. -Overall he is possibly the second-best teacher I have ever had.  The first was a teacher I had for 3 years in high school in small classes, so it says a lot about Carrell to almost achieve that in a 40-person class for 10 weeks.  Take Econ 1, take it with Carrell if he is still around (he is a visiting professor so he might leave, which would be a shame because he is exactly the person Dartmouth needs to keep).
@
Scott E.
/course/859
the material is easy to understand and the problems sets are relatively easy. But the exams are definitely not easy - beware of the final exam which is really hard even if you study a lot for it. It is simply not enough to know all the stuff in the textbook, the prof's lecture slides, and even doing the extra practice problems in the book. Prof Carrell also gives out very little practice problems in preparation esp for the final exam so that it is very difficult to study for them. Afterall, the practice problems in the textbook aren't the same level of difficulty as the ones on the exams. But on the other hand, Prof Carrell is a great lecturer. His office hours are usually packed with at least 5 people, making it very difficult to have all your questions answered, but he is willing to help you if you have trouble understanding the basic concepts.

Its Econ 1.  Nothing groundbreaking but Carrell makes lectures interesting and is a great guy to talk to.  He covers a lot of ground in class so if you don't want to work too hard outside of class then attend lectures (they are worth an hour of study time).  Just keep up because the pace is constant but certainly not out of control.

This was just a typical Econ intro class. The textbook is really clear, and Professor Gick answered all the questions people had about the readings.

If you ever take Econ 1, take it with this guy. Everything is straightforward, the guy, while somewhat dry, teaches the material well and it is all in the textbook anyway.

The only bad thing about this course, if you can call it bad, is that the curve is so high that a 95 turns into an A-.

Although I have heard of other people despising econ 1, it was one of my favorite courses at Dartmouth.  Most of this centers around the fact that I had Professor Gick.  He is excellent.  His class slides made the material extremely clear and freed us from taking copious notes, allowing us to concentrate and fully grasp the material.  The problem sets also helped to cement my grasp on the concepts.  You should have no problem in this class if you do the reading and pay attention in class.  The tests were a fair assessment of my learning.  If you are taking this course, definately try to get Gick; he is excellent.

/course/859
The content of this course is accurately described in the ORC, it's a good survey of the basics of the price system. The downside is that it is incredibly boring. Professor Gick is very intelligent and a very nice guy, but he is a horrible lecturer. He drones on in a monotone while pointing at or reading off of power point slides. Overall it is not a very difficult class and doesn't require much work. The hardest part is sitting through the lectures without gouging your own eyes out.
@

Econ 1 is pretty standard.  You get what you think you're going to get.  It's just a fairly easy introduction to microeconomics.  You do some equations, you look at supply and demand, badda-bing-badda-boom and you're done.  It wasn't even worth it to go to class (Professor Gick was hard to understand, due to his accent).

Gick is a great guy.  At least in the term in which I took this course, he was considered the "easy prof".  This was accurate, but in no way does that mean that my understanding of Economics after his course is any worse than it could have been under a more demanding prof.  His detailed lesson plans are all presented on PowerPoint, which he uploads to his Web site.  Exams were relatively easy, especially if you'd done the problem sets, but fair.  He cares about how you do in his class, and is extremely approachable.  I came out Gick's class with a complete understanding of the material, and it helped my decision to become an Econ major.

I didn't take this course seriuosly.  I thought it would be a cake walk and barey tried early on, skipped a week of classes and didn't know when the midterm was until a day before it.  I put in very little effort and got mid- to high-B's on my midterms but very high marks on my homework.  If you take this course seriously, you should have a pretty easy time getting As.  And even if you take it as a joke, you'll still get Bs probably.  It's just hard to realize I'll probably get a B on a course that I could have got an A on with a little more work. The book is great and all of Gick's lecture slides are posted on the website.  He's not a stellar lecturer, but he made class fun with his sense of humor.  Go to lecture, but stay up to date on the book and slides too. I recommend this course.  Just take it seriously and you'll be fine.

Econ 1 with Professor Gick is definitely an experience in itself. The guy might be one of the nicest professors I've ever met, and he's definitely a character. With that having been said, the class is a good introduction to micro. Looking back, I wish I had read the textbook concurrent to his lectures. He doesn't require you to at all, but reading the material makes it much more clear than the powerpoint presentations do.

Everybody always says how Econ 1 is one of the hardest courses at Dartmouth. I definitley did not agree after taking the course. I learned a lot but found it was pretty rational, common-sense stuff and the parts that aren't are well-explained by Gick. He's not the most dynamic lecturer, but he's earnest and very helpful in office hours. The book is GREAT- one of the best text books i've ever had. If you're not struggling with the material, you can learn alot of what you need to know just from the reading. I didn't get to class for over a week once, but did the reading, and didn't struggle at all. His tests are fair, although the homework and the final had some pretty tough parts.

I needed this class as a pre-req for my ENVS major, and i dreaded taking it... however it wound up being my favorite class of the term. Professor Gick, while sometimes a little hard to understand, really knows his stuff and is more than willing to review points of confusion. Plus when he screws up his english and says 'consummate' instead of 'consume' for two whole weeks it's kind of amusing... I found him very approachable, and very polite- and he LOVES talking economics and does a good job explaining one-on-one. Also, the book he uses is dynamite, and he bases his lectures right on it so there are no big surprises.

Unfortunately Econ 1 is a necessary evil.  The material is dry and the lectures are useless, but such is life.  Read the book, study hard, and this too shall pass.

The class was actually pretty boring.  If you aren't planning on majoring in Econ then DON'T take it.  Prof. Gick is a nice guy but his lectures can be somewhat dull.  The actual subject material isn't too bad but the only reason to take that class is that it is a prereq for the major.  He puts the slides on the web so going to class really isn't all that important.  You can get by without going. He did, at one point, start talking about stuff that wasn't in the text book.  That was a bad few weeks because even the study group leader didn't know what he was talking about.  The grading system is pretty fair but it isn't curved so you really have to be on the ball.

Mariger was a pretty miserable professor... he gave boring lectures, and his tests were way too hard.  The median grades on his test usually only got aobut 40-45% of the possible points, i.e. the second midterm median was 68 out of 155.  Furthermore, Mariger curved the class so that the median grade would be a B- (maybe a B but I dont think so).  Gick's class on the other hand had a median of an A-.  Mariger's problem sets were way too long, and the way they were graded (one or two problems arbitrarily chosen to determine the grade for the whole thing, usually 20 or 25 problems) was totally inadequate.  Bottom line?  I am interested in econ, and the only reason I'm going to take more is so that I won't have let Mariger turn me off from a subject that I know I have interest in.  Take this class with Gick if you can.

All I wanted was to learn a little something about economics before I graduate.  That I got, but the exams were ridiculously and unnecessarily hard adn stressful.  Luckily the scores were curved.  Lectures were pretty dry, straight from the book.  Problem sets were not too hard but they were really long, so don't leave them till the last minute.

I hope to God that Mariger never returns to Dartmouth as a visiting professor again.  At the outset, he seemed like he would be a good prof with outstanding credentials.  But as the course progressed, the class soon found that Mariger was a very inexperienced teacher whose lectures, although entirely from the book, were nonetheless unhelpful.  Students probably could have been better off solely reading the book and not showing up to any of the lectures.

The course is tough but I became very interested in the material.  The problem was that I felt like I had to teach a lot of it to myself.  The tests were so hard that a 61/155 was a B.  That shows that the class was not learning.
@

I enjoyed Econ 1, though I know many who didn't. It could have been because Mariger (visiting from D.C.) was my prof or maybe because I just really enjoyed the material. It was probably a bit of both though. The testing was tough, but if you studied well, it should have been no problem. I was anxious getting started because of what friends had said about the course, but I found the bark was far worse than the bite.

Prof. Mariger was an all right guy, decent sense of humor, but taught straight from the book and didnt give amazing lectures. I didnt go to a few classes and that held me back.

This course is TERRIBLE.  well, i guess i should say the Prof is terrible because everyone knows that Econ 1 is gonna be boring.

The material was interesting, the professor was nice, but the tests blew. It was his first time teaching, so the tests were not exactly conditioned for economics beginners. Seems like only those who took economics in high school did well on the tests.  The problem sets were tedious and time-consuming, but definitely helped me learn the material.
@
Randall P.
/course/859
First off, there were some kids (I'm assuming freshman) who would ask questions when it just wasn't appropriate or talk during class that must've made it frustrating for our prof, BUT he always seemed to have a good attitude back to taht. I felt like with the other half of the class, he had this secret with us, where we all understood eachother. He was a cool guy and despite gettting pretty far behind on the syllabus (and could've gone faster in lectures earlier in the term) I still enjoyed it. Our book, by Mankiw, was awesome.
@
Randall P.
/course/859
He knew what he was talking about, but couldn't convey it to me.  He didn't want us to converse over problems but would mark you down if they weren't perfect.  His exams were NOT like the problems assigned, although he claimed they were.

I think Mariger wasn't the best of profs for this course.  I found the material very interesting, and the textbook was wonderful in explaining all the concepts.  Even the problem sets, as tedious as they were, definitely helped me grasp each chapter.  The problem is that Mariger doesn't really know how to teach.  He's a really nice guy, but in his lectures, he repeats exactly what's in the book.  Sometimes, he'll add a little bit of supplemental information into his lectures, but when he does that, I never have any idea what he's talking about.  It's like he knows so much about the subject, but just doesn't know how to convey it to us.  He's a very tough grader, and doesn't really like it when you appeal grades.  That definitely sucks, because his tests are insanely difficult and long and don't really test us on the material.  He's just a visiting prof, though, so I don't know if he'll be staying for any other terms.
@
Randall P.
/course/859
The professor basically lectured straight from the book.  Oftentimes I would leave class feeling more confused than when I went in.  I usually understood the material better after reading the chapter than listening to his lectures.  The problem sets were often too long and the tests were extremely difficult, although the curve was good.
@
Randall P.
/course/859
I would recomend trying to get the other prof.  His students were much happier and definitly kept more of their sanity.  This prof taught many things that were outside of the book, but that left those subjects difficult to study for (for example, a score of 35% on the second midterm translated to a B).  On the other hand, we did get to learn many things that the other class did not.  Leave pleanty of time to do your problem sets, if there anything like ours they'll take up about 10 hours of your week.
@
Randall P.
/course/859
Professor Mariger knew his materials, I have to grant him that. The way he presented the materials is a bit sketchy. Several times during the courses, he would get confused over the materials himself and then spend the next five minutes trying to figure out the problem himself. At the lectures, the material was fairly presented, however during the tests, they became extremely vague and indecisive. I would venture to say, that he is a very knowledgable person, but as a teacher, he cannot convey that knowledge to students.

Great for getting a better perspective on the world in a more concrete way than unusual. Econ is a very practical and interesting subject and this course did a pretty good job of capturing that.
@
Randall P.
/course/859
Professor Mariger did a poor job of lecturing, as he literally repeated every example straight from the previous nights reading and spoke in a monotonous tone.  He shared no real-world experiences, did not involve the class, and generally inspired a lack of interest in the topic.  While the readings were straightforward, the exams did not follow the readings and questions were often ambiguous and not well thought-out.  This was startlingly evident in the curves put on the exams- oftentimes a score of 55% merited an A grade.  While the class might not be so bad with a different Prof., there is no doubt that this one brought down the class.  Amazingly, my grade in the class was pretty decent, so I am not complaining due to grades- the class was simply poorly done.
@

Econ 1 is a course everyone should take, just because it gives a good sense of how the economic world works - it is all very relevant and practical.  There seemed to be a wide variety of reactions from this class.  It's basically a course that you understand or don't understand.  If you have good mathematical sense, you'll have a pretty easy time.    Randall Mariger didn't teach very well, straight from the book, didn't respond to questions very well.

Gick is really sweet and nice, and a pretty good prof- her only downfall is her sometimes faulty English.  Still, her exams are really fair (even bordering on easy), and there are only 4 problem sets.  If you want to take Econ 1 just for a general understanding, I would suggest Gick (however, if you're a major, I think you might be behind).
@
Evelyn Gick
/course/859
It is widely understood by the members of this class that Evelyn Gick is one of the worst profs at Dartmouth. I sometimes wonder if she's here simply because her husband is a prof here as well. During class, the members of the front row would look at each other with expressions of disbelief at the prof's teaching methods. Gick has a THICK German accent and often gets confused with terms and graphs (so much so that the students are too busy trying to figure out what she's trying to explain, they can't focus on the economics). She gives NO homework at all so the tests are much harder than her slides (the median grade on the first exam was a 70). Imagine taking a calculus course with no homework, then having to take a test....there's just no practice. Furthermore, when students try to ask clarifying questions in class, she either has no idea what they mean, or she just says, "No....um, no that's not correct (but with an accent)." Avoid this prof. if you can.  The class should be a German 1 class instead of an Econ course.

Gick is a decent prof.  The biggest problem is that her command of the English language sometimes gets in the way of what she explains, and more importantly what is written on the exams.  Her lectures are just regurgutating the powerpoints she has created, which are not completely consistent with the book.

It was easy and boring. You don't need to go to class that often. The prof was alright. When students asked her questions, a lot of times she got so nervous and confused that she did not manage to figure out even the basic mistakes in calculation. Sometimes I wondered "Shouldn't she know math better as an econ prof?" But it's not too bad to take this class to get the prerequisite out of the way.
@

/course/859
The problem with Econ 1 with Prof. Gick is that it is too easy and tempting to slack off.  The testbook is pretty good.  The lectures are pretty boring - somewhat due to the prof and somewhat just because of the elementary subject matter.  After a while, you might think you are good at econ, that the class is a waste of time, that you can get everything from the textbook, etc.  You might stop coming to class.  Trust me, this is a mistake.  I skipped a lot of classes and, though, I got a good grade, it meant a lot of extra time and unnecessary effort because I would have to essentially teach myself the material through the textbook, often having to cram and take in too much at once.  Gick also sometimes puts things on her test that are either entirely not in the textbook or are given very little emphasis - it won't hurt you too much if you don't know it, but why hurt yourself?  The best thing to do is come to class, listen to the lectures, read the textbook, and do the workbook problems.  Stay focused.  Pace yourself throughout the course - read the chapters while Gick is covering them and do the workbook problems - this will reinforce the material.  The course is not that hard - if you do the above, you will have very few problems and should get a good grade easily.  Of course, that's easier said than done.

This was an into econ class so i did not expect it to be incredibly interesting. That said it was a good, basic, occasionally interesting introduction. Professor Simons was a fine teacher. She was clear enough, occasionally funny, and generally straightforward. Her expectations for quizzes and exams were definitely fair and there were no curveballs. Review sessions before tests were very helpful and she often presented material not otherwise taught- that would appear on the exam in almost the same form.

Prof. Simons has a great sense of humor and it made her lectures interesting.  As long as you actually show up for class (which a majority of class did not) you should be all right, although I never went to office hours so I couldn't say how effective she was at answering questions.  One thing-- she puts questions from the review straight onto the tests (or at least one) to "reward" students who have spent the extra time to do it, so definitely do the review!

The prof is supposedly one of the harder ones but she delivers very effective lectures.

Simons is a little difficult to understand, just teaches off a powerpoint presentation (which she clicks through way too fast), contradicts herself, and gives lousy examples.  Still, the weekly quizzes aren't too bad if you use the book, and the problem sets are excellent preparation for the midterm/final.  As long as you stay on top of the material and ask questions if you don't understand something, you should be ok.

while the professor is very good at explaining things outside of class, there won't be time in class for a lot of explanation when she mostly reiterates the book for you. you could do fine without ever going to class if you understand the textbook. but i thought the text book was confusing so i went to class and did a lot of work outside of class to try to understand the material. the tests were hard- the material she covered was fair, but the wording on the tests were tricky and i thought she could've given us more time on the tests.  she did provide a lot of practice problems, which helped a lot and the quizzes (despite a lot of complain about them in class) were very helpful.

The text book (Stiglitz) is a fascinating read and topics covered in the books and lectures are useful and quite interesting.  I think everyone at Dartmouth should take Econ 1. A bit about Professor Simons...She took me a while to get used to, but her perspective (being from Soviet Russia) added a lot to the class.  She is very helpful during office hours and her lectures basically just help explain readings.  So if you do the reading and go to lecture, you will know everything for tests without having to do much studying.

This class was pretty standard.  The lectures were right from the book, and the tests were really similar to what was in the book.  Nothing special.  Zarnowski was okay, he explained things pretty well, but he often balbbered unnecessarily to make a point.  The material was quite easy as were tests(the medians were in the high 80s).  This was kind of frustrating because making a small mistake or missing a couple multiple choice questions had big repercussions.  In the end, I'm glad I took it even though I didn't have to.

I took this class for the Environmental Studies major and actually found it to be pretty interesting. I had never taken an econ course and I think this basic, intro level material of Econ 1 is just good knowledge to have. I have no intention of taking higher level Econ classes but I'm glad I took this course. We had a problem set due pretty much every week. They were very basic and forced you to get familiar with the material even if you weren't always paying attention in class (guilty...). They made studying for the two midterms easy and not time consuming. I don't know about the other econ professors but if you have Zarnowski definitely invest in the study guide that goes with the textbook because he pulls a lot of test questions right from there and it's good, simple practice for when you're studying.  Zarnowski spent lots of class on various short tangents about the many things he's done and the places he's been. He's pretty much done everything it seems and has lots and lots of stories to tell. It kept class time interesting, listening to him go on a ten minute tangent about beer or his time at the horse races or his vacation to Russia, etc.

Overall, ECON 1 was a fine class. The material isn't incredibly interesting, but it is a necessary class if you want to continue on and take another economics class. If you know for certain that you aren't going to ever take any more economics classes I would recommend that you take ECON 2 instead.  Zarnowski was a good prof, even though some of the lectures were not very interesting at times. If you go to class, take good notes and do the homework sets, you will do reasonably well in the class.

Professor Z is retiring, so this review focuses on Econ 1 as a course rather than him. (In short, he was awesome, it's too bad you can't get him.)  My background I had taken AP Macro, and I had been exposed to economics concepts outside of class during high school.  Difficulty Some students seemed to struggle with the material, but on the whole it was straight memorization, and there was a good number of students who breezed through it. Professor Z even remarked as he was giving back the midterms once that there were "too many high grades." The class had very, very little outside work. My impression is that sometimes the class is curved- this would make it harder to do extremely well, and make it easier to do extremely poorly, so beware the possibility.  Material Economics is a very rich field, but you have to learn a lot of basic, not-so-interesting material before you can take the interesting electives. Therefore, I was disappointed by Econ 1. It could have been called "Graph Memorization 1." The final was pure "bulimic learning" which certainly made it easy, but left me feeling like I hadn't learned a lot. Apparently some people are turned on to Econ by Econ 1, but I can't picture it. Perhaps it's another one of those famed 'weeder' classes after all.  After Econ 1, you have to take stat (Econ 10) and some combination of Macro, Micro, and Econometrics (each of which I've been told is similar to Econ 1) before you can take any higher level electives you're interested in- finance, international economics, economics of development, environmental economics, game theory, etc.  A lot of people take Econ because it's "practical." I advise that you be sure that you want to explore a passion in economics before spending a slot on Econ 1. In short, it's a necessary evil- just make sure that it's really necessary, first.

Reading and homework was light.  Lectures were well organized and entertaining.  Dr. Zarnowski added a lot of life to what could have been some very bland material.  Tests were fair.  I took away a good foundation in economics.  Overall, a worthwhile course.

The reading is light, and you don't even have to do it really.  As long as you can do the homework, you'll do fine on the tests and there is only one assignment every two weeks.  The only problem is the material is pretty uninspiring since it describes idealized situations which have no true real world counterparts.

i have taken econ before so it's somewhat hard for me to judge how well he taught concepts if you weren't at all familiar with them-- but to me he seemed like he explained everything perfectly, wasn't paced too quickly, and brought in funny personal stories to keep the class a bit more interesting than it otherwise might have been, seeing as it was 845 in the morning.

Professor Zarnowski tended to recite the book chapter verbatim in class as the lectures, and the tests were almost exact copies of the homework sets, so the class required almost no effort to get a good grade.

Honestly, I really liked this class.  It depends on what you like, but I thought the material was very interesting, and logical to learn.  Zarnowski was a cool prof, funny entertaining lecturer and good at explaining graphs.  However, he gets a little tripped up sometimes if you ask a question.

Lots of material.  Not too difficult if you stay on top of it.  Econ 1 - just get it out of the way. Aggarwal was a tough grader (very picky).
@
Sheri L.
/course/859
Considering that economics is a pretty dry subject, Sheri always tried to make it interesting.  Although attendance is not required, I would definitely recommend going to class since she does cover a few topics that aren't in the reading.... Also, her tests were VERY fair.  I would recommend this prof for anyone interested in taking Econ 1.
@

/course/859
The class was ok, about what you'd expect from a crowded intro class in any department.  The grading was fair, but I felt medians were set too low, especially when compared to other profs teaching the same course.  Aggarwal will teach you well, but your gpa might be safer with someone else.  Also, she had a nasty habbit of calling x-hours ... say nearly all of them in the latter half of the term.
@

/course/859
Econ 1 is an intro class- expectations shouldn't be too high. As a senior, I had heard all sorts of horror stroies about what terms not to take it and it being so hard.  I think if you have generally good math abilities and reasoning skills you will be completely fine the material is not that complicated.  Aggarwal did a good job and kept class interesting enough.  She followed the book mostly, which made learning the material less complicated.  I think it's a class everyone should take before they graduate.

But now I am pursuing a modified major (with government)--go figure. I really needed a break from all these paper writing courses I am taking, and econ courses gave me the analytical problems I needed. I don't know how others fared in the class but the material is not difficult as long as you keep up with it. It builds upon itself, at least that is how Sheri designed her syllabus.

The course was well tought - Prof Aggarwal is a very clear lecturer and helpful outside of class.  The material, however, is pretty conservative and focuses on macroeconomics, not larger policy issues.

This was a very interesting class.  As a prospective Econ Major, I found this class with Professor Aggarwal to be a great introduction to the subject.  The course was exactly what I expected.  I had to keep up with the reading and homework in order to maintain a reasonable grade.  I would recommend this class to any who would like a little bit of a challenge and are interested in this subject.  Prof. Aggarwal kept the lectures interesting and took the time to make sure her explanations were comprehensive and understood by all of the students in the class.  Having never taken Econ before, I did have a little trouble understanding all of the material at first, but if time and effort are put into the class, it pays off in the end.  Definitely take the class with Prof. Aggarwal, she gives a great intro to Econ and it's worthwhile!
@
Sheri L.
/course/859
Prof. Aggarwal does good lectures and makes sure her students understand the material.  AT times, the course can seem slow, but this should not be a reason not to take the course.  Prof. Aggarwal provides many extra practice problems and sample exams which are helpful for studying.  She grades tough, but is a great professor.  The textbook Aggarwal uses is easy to read and understand.  The course is worth taking.  Beware of details in your test and homework answers.  You may think you did it 100% correct, but she will probably find a way to take a point off.  Be careful, but take the course.

Although econ 1 is usually thought to be really hard, it isn't. If you do the reading and make sure to understand everything, you shouldn't have any trouble.

Professor Aggarwal is superb. Her lectures are informative, and engaging. The tests are fairly difficult, but help you learn the material even better. She inspired an interest in her subject, but makes you work for everything. NOt an easy class, but a very good one.

Professor Aggarwal is one of the best teachers in the econ department-- almost everyone who takes a class with her says she is an excellent teacher and I won't disagree. She is a good lecturer, manages to put enough humor into the subject of introductory economics (not easy), and varies class activities to make everything sufficiently interesting. My only beef with her is very minor, but sometimes I think her mannerisms when listening to questions people asked suggested the question was stupid or the person was from Mars. She always answered questions well, though, so I'm not too concerned about this.  Econ 1 I think is boring by its very nature-- this is coming from someone who likes econ a lot and wants to major in it. It's hard to make indifference curves and monopolistic competition interesting but Prof. Aggarwal does the best she can with the material. The Mankiw textbook was pretty funny and very helpful. All in all, this class is a great tool for understanding how people act and the basics of economics. But I've heard bad things about a lot of the Econ 1 profs so TAKE IT WITH AGGARWAL-- you've got a sure winner.

John Scott
/course/859
Scott is a pretty awful lecturer. He uses extremely dense presentations and it's very hard to hear him if you can't get a seat at the front of the class. His tests will often base problems around topics that he might have mentioned for no more than a few minutes in class, and since there are no additional grades apart from two midterms (25% each) and the final (50%), tanking one could hurt you pretty badly. He does send out a lot of practice problems and exams that you should absolutely do, but you need to go over the class notes (which he emails to the class) in order to adequately prepare for the exams. This, however, will take a really long time since they are packed with super specific details; all of which could wind up on the tests. He's a really nice guy, but his class will be a grind even if you have some Econ experience coming in; it's possible to get an A, but it will require a lot of work. I recommend taking it with a different professor, but if you wind up taking it with Scott then definitely go to his X-hours and office hours where you can ask questions and watch him solve problems that could appear on his tests.
@

/course/859
Absolutely the worst Econ 001 Prof offered. Avoid taking him at all costs. Econ 001 is a weeder course and he is the tool of the Econ Department's Destruction.  He is an incredibly nice guy who will lure you in during the first two weeks of the quarter with his southern drawl only to murder you with his first midterm (that is worth 25% of your grade). He often throws in "Curve Balls" to his tests (your grade is solely based on your performance on two midterms and a final) where he expects for you to be able to extrapolate the answer from the material he went over in class for 5 minutes. The textbook is not very helpful but it is 100 times more helpful than his lectures. During his lectures, he rambles on mindlessly about Economic Principles that many will not understand unless they got a 5 on the AP exam and can stay awake during before mentioned lectures.   In summary, Great guy, very accommodating and understanding. Bad teacher and lecturer.
@
John Scott
/course/859
I really think he gets a bad rep; definitely is not Top 10 Worst Professor at Dartmouth. He sends practice problems and notes each night, and if you take the time to do those, the tests are not difficult. He makes the tests so it is pretty easy to get the median, and adds a few questions that are slightly more difficult that if answered correctly, allow you to get the A. If you're going to take his class, you will either hate him because you don't want to put in work outside of class or find him to be a character that is extremely dedicated to his job. Also, highly recommend going to his X-Hours, where he answers any questions in front of the chalk board. Overall, good guy that has a really bad rep.

Get professor Taylor if at all possible. Scott is clearly a genius but for a kid who never took AP econ his lectures went at 100 mph and were incredibly confusing. His problem sets were optional, but DO THEM...if you can't motivate yourself to do a non-madatory assignment then you will be screwed on the exams. The tests are hard, but he gives you ample time. Every single question requires you to draw a graph to explain what's going on, which was impossible for me because i don't think graphically. no multiple choice questions like Taylor gives. If you are an amazing econ student then i'm sure you can learn a ton from Scott, but if you're like me and very new to the subject, then you will get left behind quickly

Professor Scott is a good guy, but he's is a boring lecturer and doesn't know how to effectively teach the material. His powerpoint slides are cluttered and hard to read/understand. Most of his slides are from handwritten scanned papers, and his handwriting is mediocre at best. The graphs are also handwritten, often with slight deviations of where you would expect one point to be since the lines aren't straight etc. This makes it really difficult to teach yourself the material outside of class, since you're barely learning anything in class. I took good notes, reviewed the material regularly, and I still didn't get the grades I wanted. It seems like you can get lucky, and it's a "you either get it or you don't". But if you're going to take this class - take it with Curtis, NOT Scott.

Professor Scott is an extremely knowledgeable prof, with an impressive background, decades of experience and a great deal of enthusiasm. He is an extremely nice and supportive person. The lectures, though, are very dull. It's hard to stay awake with his monotonous voice and 50 powerpoint slides (arial on white background) a lecture. When you do listen to him though (which 90% of the class doesn't), you'll realize he really explains the material in a very clear, coherent way with a great deal of repetition when needed. He is extremely organized and loves questions that he answers always at length. He is great at office hours. I ended up cramming most of econ from wikipedia the day before the exam and hated most of the lectures, but now that I am done I realized it was not too bad. Paying attention is the key. And go to office hours. Yeah, there might be better profs for econ 1. But Scott is decent.

Keep up with the material and it'll make your life a lot easier before the exams. He can be a tough grader, but overall I thought the exams were pretty fair.

Chaudhury isn't ineffective, but she's not fantastic. She tells you that you needn't read the textbook, but that's because she uses all of the examples and figures directly from it, so you can't turn to it as an additional resource. There are a whole lot of small assignments, so exams don't count for as much of your grade as they might in another course, but you also have to do lots of busywork.
@
Parama Chaudhury
/course/859
The class was a basic economics class, but with only 10 weeks to learn the material, it goes pretty fast. Chaudhury was an okay prof...until she decided to desert the class for two weeks. While she left notes and powerpoints for the class to review before the final while she was away, I felt she was unprofessional. But, hopefully this was a one-time thing, and if so, this is a fine class to take with her.
@
Parama Chaudhury
/course/859
but also dry at times.  Chaudhury was a pretty effective lecturer.  She draws a lot of diagrams and graphs, so if you're a visual learner, it's helpful.  When she tells you that you don't have to read the book, she means it.  Don't read the book!  However, referencing the book is really good for test review or clarifying concepts that confuse you.  Chaudhury is excellent and receptive in office hours, and going definitely improves her opinion of you.  Her exams are pretty hard, and there is a lot of busywork in her class (weekly surveys, wiki group projects, and papers), but I doubt this was a negative effect on most people's grades.

I took this course because I wanted to learn about the subject of economics.  I feel that I didn't learn anything new from this course, other than putting fancy terms to things I already knew.

I took this course as a non-major to better my understanding of economics and increase my economic vocabulary.  All in all, i was pretty satisfied with the course, although i prepared myself for a lot of work, did the work, and then didn't get a poor grade in the class.  Professor Chaudhury is definitely a pretty good professor.  She explained things pretty clearly in class and had very fair tests.  I also went and saw her for a non-office hours appt and she was really friendly and explaining...before i even asked her to explain it again she would try again from a different angle, which you don't usually find in a professor!   If you do the practice test she gives you, review problem set problems and do most of the practice problems in the book, you should be all set--this coming from a anthropologist/latin americanist who is not so good at the whole numbers deal.   generally interesting course...and of course economics is applicable to almost any major...this course for me presented a new way of approaching problems, and we're all here to learn how to think so for me, it did its job.

This class effectively squashed any desire I could have had to major in econ. Prof. Chaudhury is a really nice woman, but her class was pretty brutal as a 9L, and I felt like I constantly had to be asking other econ kids to explain concepts to me, which, after their quick explanations, weren't hard to understand at all. Granted, this could be due to the fact that it was an early class and not particularly interesting subject matter-- I mean how fascinating can econ 1 possibly be?

This being Professor Berthelon's first term teaching Econ 1 at Dartmouth, I wasn't sure what to expect (there've been no useful course guide reviews prior to this one), but the course turned out great.  The subject is microeconomics, which may be a turn-off for some right from the start, but for those with a genuine interest in the subject, Berthelon was able to keep lectures lively with his subtle sense of humor and interesting supplementary material.  The homework requirements only consisted of five short problem sets (six, but the lowest grade is dropped) which took me less than an hour each, so the class barely constitutes a time committment at all.    The three exams went slightly beyond the low difficulty of the homeworks, but admittedly, they were completely fair.  Bottom line well-presented material, good prof, tiny amount of outside-class work.
@
Matias E.
/course/859
Berthelon is simply awful.  He lectures using slides straight out of the text book, only he's less clear than the text is, and more boring.  Try to take the class from a different professor (although I've heard that it can be hard to find a good intro econ teacher).  That said, if you do end up with Berthelon, you really don't need to go to class to get an A. (I went, but I didn't really pay attention.) I learned the material all out of the book and did well.  I definitely recommend taking econ, because it's really relevant to life--it helps you understand better what you read in the newspaper.  Just try not to take it with Berthelon.

Economics has become my favorite course after taking this class. It is a different way of looking at things, and yet it makes perfect sense once you learn it. Take an intro econ class at some point while at dartmouth, you wont regret it.   Berthelon was a satisfactory prof, but nothing special. Hiis lectures were a bit dry; he taught the required material well and his tests assessed exactly what he taught, meaning that if you study corrrectly you are almost guarenteed an A. The problem is that he did not truly engage me. In only one class (about international trade, the professor's specialty), was outside information brought in, the rest of the lectures develope informaiton that is otherwise found in the book. I guess that is necessary since there is a lot of basics needed to be covered in this intro course, simple though they are.   Take the class, but if you find that another prof has recieved stronger reviews weigh that, but don't let the prof dissuade you from taking intro econ.

Berthelon was the best lecturer I had my freshman fall. He was energetic, had an interesting voice (though slight accent), used hand motions, and used the powerpoint presentation well.  For me, the class was very easy. I missed half of the classes, read the book, and got an A. That being said, I enjoyed going to the lectures when I did. Berthelon was very responsive to my questions and did his best to answer them most of the time.  The tests/hw was very good reflection of material.  My biggest critique of Berthelon was his lack of sensitivity to other's viewpoints. This was especially alarming when we were discussing international trade. Berthelon denounced the reasons for tariffs quite soundly without giving much of opposing viewpoints. On the point of "tariffs can help us protect our national culture and identity," Berthelon (in a most animated way) cried that "I have no idea what this means!!! This is simply not valid!!! I don't know what this is!!!! This is so bogus, we don't need to discuss this!!" I have two problems with his behavior here. One, if he doesn't know what it means, he should not be a professor. Two, the fact that he doesn't know what it means should lead to figure that out, instead of telling us he has no idea what he's doing (literally right?) and then still saying he's right anyways.  However, in an intro econ course, perhaps opposing viewpoints is not necessary.  In any case, I thought he was a decent lecturer.

Definitely a hard class and I had to put a lot of work into it to to do well, but also definitely worth it.  If you take Econ 1, take it with Zarnowski.  He's an older guy who is really interesting and cares about his students and I looked forward to come into class every day.  To do well in his class, I would recommend studying all the problem sets (which were graded and really really similar to his tests), reading the textbook and taking notes on the textbook, memorizing graphs (towards the later part of the course just draw them over and over again they will come in handy), and going over class notes.  To get an A in this class you need a 96 or above which is lowkey absurd, but an A-/B+ you can definitely get.  Honestly great experience in this class.  Zarnowski made me love Econ and made dry material really interesting with his real life examples and funny experiences.
@
C Frank Zarnowski
/course/859
The material is mundane and simple, but the class itself can be really difficult. The curve for the class is brutal, so while a lot of people feel really confident about their knowledge, they can easily make small mistakes on midterms. Getting a B+/A- is very attainable, getting a straight A is a little tricky.
@
C Frank Zarnowski
/course/859
This class is deceptively easy. The material is straightforward and as long as you know the concepts, you should be able to apply them and solve the problems. It's only hard to get an A because Zarnowski's test questions are heavily weighted (especially the multiple choice). If you miss two multiple choice, you're already at a 95 and an A is a 96 and above. An A- ranges from 92 (inclusive) to 96 (exclusive). The grading scale is essentially a curve down. Zarnowski is a great professor though. The classes are lecture based and he doesn't leave much room for questions (kind of plows through like a bulldozer), but you'll find that you won't be needing to ask many questions simply because of the nature of the material (like I said, straightforward and questions are easily self-answerable with resources like textbooks and study guides). Plus, you'll find that you don't really want to interrupt his interesting stories anyways. If you do have questions, he's ready to talk during office hours (where, again, you will learn more about his interesting stories). Admittedly, he can sometimes go off on a small tangent but his reasoning behind telling such stories is to make us remember the content. Some people find the content really dry so he tries his best to make it entertaining and applicable. Economics 1 made me consider an economics major. Be sure to utilize outside-of-class resources like tutors, study groups, and the study guide held on reserve!

i transferred to his class after sitting in for one period. he's so much more engaging than prof anderson! i thought i can never getting an a after bombing my first mid-term with a b+, but in the end i did (by doing a ton of practice questions from the study guide and maybe getting a perfect score on my final). Dr Z is really cool and very approachable. He is like a nice, warm grandpa! definitely take it with him (he doesnt teach in the winter)! i also love the textbook he chose for the class, very readable. this class is hands down my fav class of the term. but just bear in mind that the class it big, the line in front of his office can be long, and the curve is VERY DEMANDING. but would definitely recommend.

/course/859
He's a fantastic storyteller, who brings concepts to life with interesting stories in class – but most of the stories are just about how awesome his life was and don't help your understanding of economic concepts. All of his problem examples are exactly the same as the textbook, so it's debatably a waste of time to show up if you've read the textbook. He "does not know how to use email," so he requires students to meet him during office hours (during the 2A, which sucks) if you have any questions. Does not know how to use Canvas either, so everything is on paper. If you lose the syllabus from the first day you're screwed. There are three midterms and a final. He literally lost my first midterm so I had to just believe that the grade he remembered is what I actually earned. However, he misgraded my next two midterms, so I doubt that the first grade was correct. Overall, this was the worst experience I've had with a teacher in my lifetime, but it was a decent class.

Great professor, lecturers can be a little dry at times, read the textbook, there's a supplement workbook that goes along with the textbook that's also pretty helpful, the cut off scores for grades were pretty high, you needed a 96+ to get an A and a 92-96 to get an A-, his exams were fair but each multiple choice was worth 2.5 points so miss 2 questions and you're already down to an A-, homeworks were graded on accuracy, Zarnowski was always available during office hours one on one to help which was nice

If you get a chance to take Econ 1 with Lusardi, you should absolutely do it. She is a fantastic lecturer and she really knows how to teach economics to 'poets' and 'economists' alike. She understands if you're an aspiring Geithner or you are only in this class to fulfill a distrib.  She is also hilarious in her own way. Lusardi is a great professor to get to know. She is always available to help, even given her busy schedule in Washington DC, and especially during midterm/final time - she arranges discussion groups, study groups, and has both her own office hours, office hours for her TAs [during midterm/finals time] and 'blitz office hours' too.  The econ itself is engaging, but that's a matter of personal preference. Regardless, if you devote time to doing the problem sets each week, and pay attention during lectures, Lusardi's class and teaching are excellent.

Most of the material is very simple and easy.  Prof does a horrible job presenting the material in the lectures and never teaches you the long answer questions in class. My grade was sub-par simply because i was never taught how to do higher level long answer questions. i would advise anyone with the time to focus on these questions in the problem sets and go into her office hours or have someone explain them to you.  She is not very helpful.  She's probably preoccupied with her research project she is conducting.

The material is mundane and simple, but the class itself can be really difficult. The curve for the class is brutal, so while a lot of people feel really confident about their knowledge, they can easily make small mistakes on midterms. Getting a B+/A- is very attainable, getting a straight A is a little tricky.

This class is deceptively easy. The material is straightforward and as long as you know the concepts, you should be able to apply them and solve the problems. It's only hard to get an A because Zarnowski's test questions are heavily weighted (especially the multiple choice). If you miss two multiple choice, you're already at a 95 and an A is a 96 and above. An A- ranges from 92 (inclusive) to 96 (exclusive). The grading scale is essentially a curve down. Zarnowski is a great professor though. The classes are lecture based and he doesn't leave much room for questions (kind of plows through like a bulldozer), but you'll find that you won't be needing to ask many questions simply because of the nature of the material (like I said, straightforward and questions are easily self-answerable with resources like textbooks and study guides). Plus, you'll find that you don't really want to interrupt his interesting stories anyways. If you do have questions, he's ready to talk during office hours (where, again, you will learn more about his interesting stories). Admittedly, he can sometimes go off on a small tangent but his reasoning behind telling such stories is to make us remember the content. Some people find the content really dry so he tries his best to make it entertaining and applicable. Economics 1 made me consider an economics major. Be sure to utilize outside-of-class resources like tutors, study groups, and the study guide held on reserve!

i transferred to his class after sitting in for one period. he's so much more engaging than prof anderson! i thought i can never getting an a after bombing my first mid-term with a b+, but in the end i did (by doing a ton of practice questions from the study guide and maybe getting a perfect score on my final). Dr Z is really cool and very approachable. He is like a nice, warm grandpa! definitely take it with him (he doesnt teach in the winter)! i also love the textbook he chose for the class, very readable. this class is hands down my fav class of the term. but just bear in mind that the class it big, the line in front of his office can be long, and the curve is VERY DEMANDING. but would definitely recommend.

He's a fantastic storyteller, who brings concepts to life with interesting stories in class – but most of the stories are just about how awesome his life was and don't help your understanding of economic concepts. All of his problem examples are exactly the same as the textbook, so it's debatably a waste of time to show up if you've read the textbook. He "does not know how to use email," so he requires students to meet him during office hours (during the 2A, which sucks) if you have any questions. Does not know how to use Canvas either, so everything is on paper. If you lose the syllabus from the first day you're screwed. There are three midterms and a final. He literally lost my first midterm so I had to just believe that the grade he remembered is what I actually earned. However, he misgraded my next two midterms, so I doubt that the first grade was correct. Overall, this was the worst experience I've had with a teacher in my lifetime, but it was a decent class.

Great professor, lecturers can be a little dry at times, read the textbook, there's a supplement workbook that goes along with the textbook that's also pretty helpful, the cut off scores for grades were pretty high, you needed a 96+ to get an A and a 92-96 to get an A-, his exams were fair but each multiple choice was worth 2.5 points so miss 2 questions and you're already down to an A-, homeworks were graded on accuracy, Zarnowski was always available during office hours one on one to help which was nice

Read the textbook before class and do the practice problems. There's an online part of the textbook that you can access for ~15$, and it has a lot of MC practice problems. If you get this you should easily get at least an A-. Prof Frank was great but sometimes would get sidetracked by his stories, and it is easy to get bored in class as the material is not very exciting. However, as long as you read the textbook before class you will be set.

Course Interesting, easy course—if you like economics.  Professor He knows his stuff very well, although he does tend to stray off in his stories.   Workload You have to do a readings (2 chapters/ week), then a problem set that should be easy if you go to class and do the readings.

Course Although some people find Econ 1 dry, I thought it was pretty interesting. Obviously you need to take this to move on in the department (with the exception of AP credit). The course matched the textbook well, which made it easy to pre-read/compare. It was well organized; material was covered in an order that made sense, not simply front to back in the textbook.  Professor Zarnowski was excellent. He really knows his economics, and I thought he was a very clear explainer. He mixes in a lot of stories to his lectures. Some are helpful to understand the material, some are not. Most are interesting. He is also an extremely interesting guy; I wish I had gone to more office hours to hear his life story.  Workload Workload was manageable. Not easy, not super hard. I pre-read the textbook before class, as well as doing the homeworks. The homeworks aren't bad, it was one per week. However, the homeworks would take longer because I would want to go over them multiple times to make sure I didn't make any errors.
@
C Frank
/course/859
Course A Very Different Opinion Please Read  Professor While most people seemed to like Zarnowski, I felt that he was incompetent and unfocused. More than half of class time is spent discussing his personal experiences that have absolutely nothing to do with Econ. He seems more interested in himself than in giving his students a good education. He is unable to explain anything, and you are significantly better off learning from the textbook and just not showing up during class. Although there is a few things in his lecture not covered in the textbook. Honestly, I would just suggest switching professors.  Just an extra little thing, most people in Curtis's class complain about the curve. I don't know about Curtis's class, but I've heard that she does a down-curve or something? Well, people told me that Zarnowski set the A grade to 96% so I don't see how that is any better than a down-curve.  Workload The homeworks are clumsily written. Many of the questions are simply unsolvable because he wrote the question wrong or unclearly. Some of the test questions are also clumsily written, sometimes to the point that they become unanswerable. Some test questions are also unfairly tricky and purposely misleading for no apparent reason (the trickiness has nothing to do with your ability to think critically. It seems like he just wants a way to take off points). Furthermore, the time limit forces you to be a little hurried during the test, leading to careless mistakes that are not indicative of your understanding of the material. Furthermore, considering that an A is a 96%, it's basically impossible to get an A since the tests and homeworks are so faulty. Some of the test questions are also not covered in the textbook or lecture, so that the only way to get them right is to already know them from some random knowledge you have beforehand. I am very angry about how unfair this course was, and I feel like it has been a complete waste of my time because the concepts taught were so ridiculously simple. He just does trivial things to make the grades lower. This class has been my worst experience at Dartmouth so far.  Do not let this class discourage you from becoming an Econ major though. This class is not an accurate representation of what other Econ classes are like. Some people actually even like this class, so perhaps you might too. I know that I'm in the minority for not liking this class, but I think I have more than enough reasons to justify my disappointment. I feel that students who enjoyed this class only did so because they enjoyed the stories he told. However, class time is not meant for such things. If you're a student who wants a grade that represents your effort and ability, you will probably be very disappointed with this prof.

He tended to get off track with stories, but they often added entertainment to the class and sometimes helped understand the material. Best teacher offered definitely.

Shenhav is the best! She really tries hard to make the class interesting in spite of the relatively boring content (graphs etc.) and is super available and accessible for help outside of class if you take the initiative to reach out to her. She doesn't give you a grade worse than you deserve (i.e. she will give you an A if you average a 94 unlike some other econ 1 classes), and she's super chill and didn't comment when I went to sleep in class. Highly recommend taking it with her!

Good class, lectures were a bit dry. If you have taken AP Micro in high school, you will probably have an advantage. Exams were difficult, although Shenhav's exams are easier than other teachers' exams I believe and cover slightly less material. The class has very little workload. There are six problem sets for homework throughout the term. Each probably takes around two hours of work. Two midterms, and one final exam. Concepts are difficult and there are a lot of graphs but if you review the powerpoints, problem sets, and the sample tests than you should be good to go. Shenhav also holds office hours and is open to having students ask her questions about Economics

Course A boring course made worse by a boring, ineffective prof  Professor Knowledgable prof, but his teaching style was not great. Fair grader but his tests were shitty, and he didn't prepare you well (i.e. his practice problems, the only non-reading homework given in the class, were straight from the textbook and weren't modeled after the test problems at all).  Workload Workload was very manageable/nearly non-existent. Reading a boring chapter each night did not take long--considering there were end of chapter summaries and in-chapter highlights of important info--and problem sets, which were given a little less often than every week, were easy. I probably would have preferred the workload my friends in Zarnowski's class had because their longer problem sets actually seemed to prepare you for tests.

Course Material was a little dry, although the unit on game theory was fairly interesting. Too many graphs with no real-life applications. Overall a decent introduction to what econ is, although perhaps could have been a litlte more interesting.   Professor Professor definitely knew what he was talking about, but lectures were rather dry. Used the same 2-3 examples for everything (him getting a PhD, apples being picked by workers, going to college to get a degree vs. working out of high school). Fair grader, reasonable tests made up for the fact that lectures could be a little uninspiring.   Workload Go to class, take good notes, read the chapter quickly after class, do the problem sets and you're golden.

I really liked Econ in high school, so I thought this class would rekindle that interest even though it was an intro level class.   That, however, didn't happen. While the lectures were well-organized and the schedule and problem sets were straightforward, everything was rushed unnecessairly...even for a Dartmouth course.  The final grade was based on one midterm, one final and the last two of eight problem sets. This made it hard to recover from a poor grade early in the course. The problem with the exams was that they were both much too long for the allotted time. I didn't have enough time to finish either exam, and I wasn't the only one.  Most of the problems were probably because this was professor Bucher-Koenen's first term teaching. I liked her, though, because she was well-organized and because she tried to make dry intro material interesting by using real-world economic examples from her home continent of Europe.
@
William Fischel
/course/859
Professor Fischel is nice enough, but because it's an intro class and he's lax, it winds up being ineffective. Homework is rarely assigned and doesn't really count for anything, so you need to be very self-motivated to stay on top of the material and understand everything. It doesn't help that it isn't the most interesting of subjects, and Fischel doesn't make that any better, aside from cracking occasional jokes. If you need to take this class, try to take it with another prof that will make it more engaging.

This is Psych 1...For being such a large, standard intro course it is actually pretty interesting. Tse was ok, Kelley and Wheatley were great, and I did not like Kleck at all. By the end of the term, you are expected to have read the whole textbook. Do this reading! It really helps, as does using the study guide that comes with the textbook to prepare for tests. The tests are all multiple choice and can be a little nit-picky but i've never had too much of a problem doing well.
@
Robert Kleck
/course/2477
First, the class has 4, 50-question multiple choice tests (one for each professor), with a final in the same style. You read four chapters per two-week unit, which are about 40 pages each. The test grading system was not my favorite - it was based on percentiles, that is, your grade depended on how everyone else did. The problem is that this pins students against one another...not a great strategy.  The class is extremely fast paced. I think Psych would be better fit with a separate intro class for each field, because there is too much information crammed into to small a time period. Professors often have to pick and chose what they lecture on, and the rest you have to teach to yourself. The class is pretty much memorization, so brace yourselves.  Kelley was great...I'd definitely take another class with him. His lectures were extremely entertaining, and he did a good job conveying his points. Wheatley was excellent. While her class wasn't the same "fun" atmosphere as Kelley, her lectures were among the best I've seen here at Dartmouth. You leave the class knowing exactly what she wanted you to understand, and not at all bored. Kleck was pretty good - his personality is great, but I sometimes got lost as to what he was trying to do in his lectures. He gave great examples, but often failed to tie them to concrete concepts. Tse, on the other hand, was downright terrible. His lectures were all over the place, with no sense of order or organization. His test was absurd, often asking questions relating to sheer specifics (who invented this theory), rather than concepts (what is this theory). One prof I will avoid like the plague in the future.  Bottom line - If you want to take another psych class, take it - it's not awful, and probably worth it in the long run. If you're not thinking of majoring though, I'd say stay away. It's no walk in the park, and a real toss up.

I'm thinking about majoring in engineering, but out of three courses i took this term, this was by far my favorite and has made me consider double majoring or minoring with psychology. You'll love to go to class--the professors are all great Lecturers and crack funny jokes. The material we had to learn for the tests was so interesting. It's a course that every college student should take before they graduate.   Be aware you learn only 20% of what you will be tested on in lecture. 80% you have to learn on your own from the text book. Also, the curve is very very harsh. If you're all about getting good grades, this is not the course for you. It's not an easy A by any means.   Advice 1) Make sure you go over all your old tests for the final (it will be the most important piece of studying you do). 2) Go to the text book website (http//www.wwnorton.com/college/psych/psychsci3/ch/01/flashcards.aspx) to download flash card sheets (excel or word sheets that have all the bold words defined for the chapter). 3) If you're a girl, sign up for T-point experiments at the beginning of the week before they disappear--it's harder for girls to sign up for experiments because many of them are all-male. 4) Don't do all the readings the night before. 5) Get to know the professors and ask lots of questions. They're cool people that you might end up wanting to do research with in their lab. They'll also drop you good tips and hints about studying for upcoming exams.

the curve for psych 1 is infamous at dartmouth - it curves you down to a B-.  It's rough  to survive, you either a. have credit from AP test (so you can get of this class) or b. have to tough it out  I think the profs are brilliant and they really encourage me to go on with the major since I'm not terribly happy with my grade.  It's like I'm above the median, but that still means very little when the median is artificially set soo low.  But the profs make it semi-worth it, I'd say.  Trust me, everyone b**tched and moaned about this class.  Even the people who did super well complained about how much reading there is and how dense the material is.  But I guess, if you have to take it, take it.  My advice to you - read the book before you even get to class.  There's just too much reading and you'll feel swamped with 2 other classes - if you're satisfied with a B, okay, you'll most likely be fine.  You can read once and get roughly the median or a little below.  But to be above the median is hardddd.  Getting an A requires so much effort that some people would just prefer to allot more time to other classes - go to office hours. the profs will try their best to help you - don't just transcribe notes. actually UNDERSTAND them first, then underline. don't waste time recopying notes. you will realize that you don't have any time  good luck!

The class material is very interesting; lectures are generally good; and the textbook is very informative (if pretty long).   Pretty much the old bad part of the class is the test-- it's only multiple choice, and it's curved down to a B- (although you can do experiments over the course of the term to give yourself a 'bump' in your grade). Unfortunately, the test seems to reward specific facts rather than understanding of the material-- so it's good if you're good at memorizing, but not so good if you prefer application/concepts.
@

The class was extremely boring as the lectures attempted to convey information that is common sense.  The lectures also tend to dwell on the same few issues for days at a time.  The boring lectures were largely useless in preparing for the exam as most of the questions, which are multiple choice, are from the textbook.  Some of the questions are fair while others are just surprising.  You must memorize the textbook and stay awake while reading its painful chapters to do well in this class.  Also, the entire unit of abnormal psychology was not discussed in lectures and was glossed over in the textbook.  Unless you are willing to take a boring course with a bad grading system, take Psychology 6 instead.
@

This class was never boring and by far my favorite to attend. However, it is tough having four teachers because each one only write one test, so you never get used to a teaching style. Each one was so funny and well spoken. I barley had to study lectures for the tests because I simply remembered what profs said from being so engaged.   As much as people complain about the multiple-choice test format of this class, I can honestly say psych 1 was my only class where my grade was always a function of my studying.  The tests I stayed up later studying for (because I pushed it to the last minute) I did worse on, while the ones I really prepared for I did well on. Because a lot of the material is only in the textbook you have to do the reading and make your own study materials.  However, the concepts are not hard to grasp, it's just a lot to remember.  If it wasn't multiple choice it would be a lot harder.  The curve is tough, and can disadvantage people who get below the median, but generally it works out so people get the grade they deserve.    Also, if you take this class get your t-points!!! So many people don't take advantage of this free extra credit.  If you email the chair of the class because there are not enough experiments for you to do he/she will figure out a way to get you the points.

Psych was very interesting and I liked learning that basics of a very in-depth and applicable field. Only half the lectures were interesting, they didn't really help you learn the material. If you're interested in Psych, but know you don't want to major, just read the book. I wish I would have done that. The material is cool, but having to memorize the entire book for the multiple choice tests is a waste of time.  The tests were fair to a certain extent. They're all based on the book with a few questions from lecture. Some questions and answers were very ambiguous, which was annoying. Some questions are also just common sense. The grades can be frustrating too because they are graded based on percentile, so they can be curved down. Luckily there's extra credit (T-points) which can raise your grade.

5 tests of 50 multiple choice questions. 35 q's from the book and only 15 q's from lectures.  Tests are hard and the bell curve really sucks, and you basically just read the entire text book.

The 50MCs also cover tons of content since both book and lectures are tested (and the lectures don't always cover the same material as the textbook).

there are 100+ students, so tests are MC, which, yeah, sucks.  it's not a fair or valuable means of gauging how well we understood the material.    the textbook was all right, but there was a lot of material and you needed to know most of it for the class.  there were t-points which allowed you to be subjects in experiments and boost your grade.    jernstedt=a fucking rockstar.  tse=sleep-inducing.

I took this class to take an easier third class to go along side some other typical pre-med classes and I want to be a psych major now.  I looked forward to lecture so much and I cannot wait to take more classes in the department.  The professors are amazing and very funny!  Professor Tse was the driest of the four and perception was my least favorite section, but Professor Tse is still great but perhaps just overshadowed by the amazing lectures given by his colleagues.  You will love this class and if you keep up with the readings you will be fine.  The curves on the mult. choice exams are the only downside (most of the time the curve worked against me) but  the department allows you to participate in experiments for extra credit, which makes up for the most part for the awful curve.

This class made me want to be a psych major. Although it was pretty reading-intensive (200+ textbook pages per exam) and attending class was really important (there were 15 lecture questions per exam), if you read, go to class, and study for the exams, you'll do well.  There were four exams and a final. A few questions per exam were really specific and tricky, but the majority of questions were straightforward.  Jernstedt and Whalen are both awesome professors.

It was so fascinating, and the teaching was so great that most of my conversations revolved on the cool things I learned in Psych. A great class to take if you are sick of your own major and just want to learn something new and interesting, to revive the desire to learn. That being said, definitely NRO the class because it s so, so easy to do OK but the way the curve works, it s virtually impossible to get a good grade. At one point I had a 48/50 and that was a B+.

The reading is also absolutely fantastic and super good about bringing in diverse perspectives on psychology.  Seriously, you will not regret learning about this stuff because it blows your mind.  My only complain is that the curve is a bitch for the tests and will absolutely tank your grade in the class even if you get a couple wrong.

The material is interesting, and for the most part the lecturers are pretty effective. (Kleck is excellent in lecture, but his exam was quite difficult. Hughes was somewhat entertaining, but to the detriment of actual education. Heatherton's lectures were excellent. Wheatley was engaging, but I think she would have been better had she been lecturing in the area in which she specializes.)  The grading, however, leaves a lot to be desired. One's grade is based almost entirely on one's percentile in the class, which can prove absurd at times. (In our class, 16% of the students received a perfect score on the first exam.) However, you can get extra credit points for participating in experiments.  Take this course if you're interested in psych, but don't expect it to be an easy third course that you can blow off entirely.

This class covers a lot of really fascinating material.  Having 4 different professors divide the term into quarters keeps you on your toes and exposes you to new and interesting viewpoints, since each professor focuses on an area most interestin to them.  Jernstedt, Kleck, and Whalen are all great lecturers.  Cohen isn't bad, but he's so hyper that he's sometimes a little hard to follow and my attention would wander.  There is no work for this class except reading the textbook and frequent multiple-choice exams.  The exams aren't easy, but as long as you put in a decent amount of time reading and reviewing they aren't terrible.    This makes a great third class if you're at all interested in the subject, but if you want an easy A in return for no work, look elsewhere.

the material is REALLY interesting and i enjoyed lectures and reading mostly, but the tests are graded in a way that makes it really hard to do well. even if you do alright on a test, you can still be in a really bad percentile and thus get a bad grade. cohens section was by far the worst-his test was too hard and he didnt explain the material well. whalen and kleck were great. jernstedt is very straightforward and organized. definitely take this, but beware that it will affect your GPA.

I thought that material was fascinating -- for majors/non-majors alike. Jersntedt is really great, as is Whalen, and Kleck is decent. SO if you have those three at all, def take the class -- they're good lecturers, and cool guys, especially jersntedt and whalen. Cohen sucks, but what can you do... his tests were hard too. The tests in general aren't very easy -- they're all multiple choice which i'm not very good at it... so it's not easy to get an A in this class, and it's possible you can study very hard and not do very well... but I deifnitely recommend accumulating T-points -- seriously, try and get 8 if you can. it's the kind of class you take to learn a lot, not necessarily do well in... tho the B-range is def doable. overall, TAKE IT for just interest's sake -- it's only a lot of reading every 2 weeks, no real homework... deifnitely worth it in my opinion! i liked it a lot.

All four professors were on top of their game and gave engaging, energetic lectures, though Cohen lagged behind the other three in terms of effectiveness.  Professors Jernstedt and Kleck provided lecture outlines, which were quite helpful when studying for exams, but beware that most of the material on exams comes directly from the text and not from lecture. However, I still attended every class.  This course has led me to take another psych class, and I'd encourage anyone with even a passing interest in learning about psychology to take it.

Psyc one is pretty much what you'd expect it to be.  Its a general overview that doesn't really help you learn any of the material for future psyc classes, or show if psyc. as an overall major would be a good choice.  That said, the lectures are relatively entertaining and interesting (though they barely pertain to the tests which are entirely about the reading - which is A LOT).  It isn't really necessary to ever go to class and the tests are pretty easy.  Overall an OK class, but nothing too exciting.

Each chapter is about 30 pages long and if you take the time to take notes on the chapter it will take you 2-3 hours to get through.  There is a lot of test material from the book, not just the lectures which makes studying for tests a large task because you are responsible for all the readings assigned AND any other information mentioned in the lectures.   On professors, some were excellent some weren't.

The 5 50-question multiple-choice exams are almost entirely based on the reading.  There is really no need to attend lecture though some of the lectures were really interesting (aside from Tse's--I fell asleep in the 2 lectures of his that I attended).  As long as you do the readings and review them before the exams you should do well in this class.  This class is pretty fast paced and really broad.  You cover a lot of information in a short period of time so it's really easy to fall behind.

An intro class is an intro class... don't expect too much from it. It's a primer on psychology, so that's what you get - a primer. And it's a prereq for psych majors and minors, so you gotta do what you gotta do.   The tests really suck, because it's just testing the "recognition" of the material versus "recall" which is fine, but also not the best way to test. It makes sense for the class size though, so just read the book (and I mean seriously, READ the book) and you'll be fine. You don't really need to go to lectures as long as you read the book to do well on tests. The sucky thing is that since this is what everyone's doing, the 1 or 2 problems that come up on tests from lecture that you get wrong will put you in the 85th percentile or so in the class.   Kleck and Hughes were effective lecturers, and Wheatley was awesome, I actually looked forward to her lectures. Tse, however, is so boring you will be drawn to sleep. It's a good warning for looking at future classes to take though, I must say.

I've seen a lot of people trying to take psych 1 out of pure interest. Well, don't do it. The material itself is interesting, but the lectures are so fast paced that they don't help much. 90% of what I learned from this course comes from the textbook. Also, the curve is pretty strict; it is easy to get a medium grade, but is really hard to get an A. So if you're concerned of your GPA and just have a mild interest in this subject, just buy a psychology textbook and study it on your own.  On the other hand, this course is great for to-be psych majors. It really allows you to build a foundation for future studies. Also, you get to see which field of psychology interests you.

Heed the warning, the class is graded entirely on 5 tests given. Each are 50 questions and multiple choice. But that's not the worst part. The grades are given by percentile rank in the class, so if you're in a class with geniuses, expect a B or C no matter what. Also, since it's multiple choice, one wrong answer can mean the difference in 15 percentile points, which could equal a letter grade (maybe not that drastic)  You have to be motivated to take this class because there's no homework and you don't have to come to a single lecture all term. Having said all that, every Psych major has to take this class, so do your best.

This course was ok, but you can't expect miracles from an intro course. Prof. Hughes, while providing interesting lectures didn't really cover material we would be tested on. The textbook is relied on heavily. Kleck and Tse both provided interesting lectures, and Wheatley did a good job, but obviously isn't as comfortable lecturing and had a huge stack of notes, which made her a little more dry.

This course is just as advertised.  Go to lecture and do the readings and you will most likely do fine.  Doesn't make you take concepts to the next level, just tests whether you read and understood the material presented.  There are five 50 question multiple choice exams each worth 20% of your total grade.  There is one exam per unit (2 weeks long, each taught by a different professor) for a total of 4 exams and then a cumulative final.  The textbook was excellent, the material interesting, and all professors, except for Prof. Tse, were good.  I would recommend taking the course.

This course is a great way to be introduced to several of the professors in the psychology department; however, it's mostly useful as a prerequisite for higher-level classes and it's generally regarded as one of the worst classes in the department (I know psych majors who say it was their least favorite class, but they ended up majoring anyway).   The material covered in lectures is a good overview of psychology, but the course is somewhat disorganized- several topics were covered multiple times, and some were left out entirely. The exams were ridiculous. they covered sections of the book that had not been discussed at all in class and it felt as though the professors used the grading curve as an excuse to include absurd questions on the exams. That said, if you read the book you'll do fine on the exams.   The professors were mostly good lecturers; I thought Hughes was a riot until I started studying for the exam and realized I knew nothing I was supposed to know, but I still enjoyed his part of the class. Tse was a boring lecturer but he knew his material. Kleck was surprisingly humorous, and made an effort to connect the material to life at Dartmouth.   Wheatley's a great prof, the course was worth taking just for her section, which was clear, to-the-point, engaging, and hilarious! She would end lectures early, simply because she'd covered everything she needed...take psych 1 with her if you can.
@
Robert Kleck
/course/2477
The class material was interesting, but it's a survey course with four different professors. The profs didn't communicate completely, so some material was covered multiple times and lots of material wasn't ever coved. A couple of the profs weren't very effective in-class, so overall the lectures weren't all that helpful.
@
Robert Kleck
/course/2477
Hughes was funny and decently interesting, but got very off topic and didn't really finish his section of the course.  Tse was really interested in the material he was teaching, but that did not translate into interesting lectures. Very, very boring.  Wheatley was awesome. Really interesting stuff and inspired me to take her class in the winter. (Psyc 23)  Kleck was pretty interesting, but could get dry at times. Pretty hard test.  Overall, the class was pretty good and the team teaching method had its pros and cons. You never got sick of a prof, but you could never really get a feel for what they would ask on tests either. As long as you went to class and read the text, it didn't take much work to do decently on the tests. I would say that it is interesting overall and is a class worth taking.

The subject material for this class was all very interesting and reading the chapters in the textbook wasn't bad at all. But every single grade you get in this class is from a multiple choice exam. I found this to be really frustrating and not a real accurate way to see if a student learned anything.   I wouldn't recommend this class unless you either need it for the major, or are really good at multiple choice tests. However you do get to find out that the Psych Professors are all pretty good/interesting.
@

As with most introductory courses, Psych 1 is just a survey of the department. It is taught by four different professors who each lecture on their specialized fields. The course skims the surface of a lot of material to give you a taste of the whole department. That being said, I would not recommend taking this course just  because you have a vague interest in psychology. If, however, you are interested in taking any other courses within the department, this is a prerequisite you just have to get through.  The material and tests were not difficult, per se, but the grading is what could kill you. It is all based on percentiles, so 90% of the questions correct on an exam could really turn out to be in the B range percentile. Be prepared to do some thorough textbook reading for the exams, especially for the final. My advice would be to make a schedule for the readings and try to stick to it as much as possible. Also, definitely take advantage of T-points!  I could comment on each of the professors, but different professors teach this course each term. I would, however, recommend taking a class with Wheatley if you are interested in social psychology. She's a very effective lecturer and all of her classes were very interesting.

I like psych, and this class caught my interest. Its a big lecture class, so don't expect any personal attention (unless maybe you  work hard and seek it out), but don't let that bother you. The lectures range from above average to great. The only grading is five equally weighted multiple choice tests, to prepare for you need only read a few chapters from the textbook. Over the course you read 1 complete textbook and thats it, really not bad at all. I found the tests to be easy, but its graded on a curve so somebody has to be the bottom half...
@

/course/2477
The fact that this class was taught by four profs had its pros and cons. For people interested in majoring, it's good because you get to know the teaching style of four of the department's professors. It's bad because the difficulty of the exams and the quality of the lectures are inconsistent.  You definitely learn a lot, and it's a good intro to psychology. Cohen's exam was unnecessarily hard and covered info that wasn't emphasized at all in the lectures. Heatherton's was fairer. Kleck's was combined with the final, and Kelley actually gave a study guide.
@
Robert Kleck
/course/2477
I took this course out of interest. The subject is fascinating, but with 150 students enrolled, the exams are unfair. The 5 multiple choice exams that mamke up your grade are arbitrary. You can study long and hard and not get a great grade. It's easy because there are no papers and not much reading, but difficult because you have to know EVERYTHING in the book in order to do well. Despite my disapointing grade, I really enjoyed the class and feel like I learned a lot. Definitely take it if you're at all interested in psychology, just be prepared to study more than you think you need to.

Kleck is responsive and commanding. Heatherton's lectures are too fast and dense. He's also too caught up in himself. Cohen is pretty good. Kelley is HILARIOUS and entertaining and GAVE you a reason to get to class on time. he also gave a study guide for his section. THE CURVES ARE TERRIBLE. Few people get A's. The athletes all cheat off of each other and mess up the curve. GET T-POINTS!

This class is definitely a lot of work.  There is a ton of reading, but it is so worth it.  The material is so interesting and relevant to your daily life.  Also, the professors make their lectures fun and interesting in different ways by showing movies, involving the class, etc.  I highly recommend this class!

The professor who wrote the textbook is especially bad. Get ready for tons of pointless Freud bashing and scan-tron tests which are laiden with mistakes. Only take this if you absolutely must. The professors could not possibly have put less effort into teaching this course, and it shows.

Overall this was a good class. The professors were all nice, and tried to help the students.  Heatherton and Kelley were clearly much better lecturers than Kleck or Cohen.

Psych 1 is a lot of fun!  Four profs taught this course Ann Clarke (neurobiology and abnormal psych), Russell Hughes (learning, sensory processes, perception, and cognition), Todd Heatherton (developmental and personality psych), and Robert Kleck (social psych). All four gave informative, entertaining lectures. The lectures were very different from the readings, which was nice because it exposed us to many different topics and viewpoints in psychology.   There were five multiple choice exams, all of which weighed equally into the final grade. Each prof gave an exam for his/her portion of the course. The fifth exam was cumulative (and very easy).  The fourth and fifth exams were taken together during finals.  The other three were taken at two week intervals throughout the term. We read four 30-40 page chapters in the textbook for each exam. The readings were easy and interesting, but also time-consuming. The exams were entirely multiple choice, covering information from the textbook and lectures. We had an hour to complete fifty questions. No one struggled to finish on time. The exams are very easy if you complete the assigned readings and attend the lectures. Just take your time and read the questions carefully.   Students can participate in enjoyable psych experiments for extra credit (T-points). If you receive the maximum 8 T-points (for 8 hours of experiments), your grade will increase by one step (eg. B+ to A-). Fewer than 8 T-points may also increase your grade, depending on your number of T-points and where you lie on the curve. It is very easy to earn all 8 T-points, and most students choose to do so. This converts the exam median grade of B-/B into a final median grade of B or B+.   Take this class! You'll love it!

I wouldn't even call this a "course."  The course started off with Scott Grafton (I won't even call him professor, because not once in the entire span of the course did he ever act like one...at best, he was an exam proctor), who would come into class, throw random Magic Eye illusions on the overhead and mumble at the class for half an hour.  Then he'd dismiss "class" 15 minutes early.    Grafton was, by far, the worst professor I've encountered in my entire time at Dartmouth (and I've completed 11 classes at this point).  He had a very disturbing attitude of "let me put up random illusions and mind games and I won't explain their connection to the course material.  if you figure it out, great for you, and if you don't, that's great, too."  Grafton was never available the 3 weeks that he taught class.  He rarely responded to emails and was apparently out of town all the time when he wasn't in class.  Robert Kleck, who taught a portion of the course, and Ann Clark, were very informative and helpful during office hours.  Their portions of the course were bearable.  But at the end of the course, Neil Macrae came in and did nothing but crack jokes about his accent.  He, too, was very unresponsive to student needs and threw on random videos to kill time.  Folks, don't waste $3000+ of tuition for a class where the teacher will come in and throw on random videos and illusions on the overhead to kill time.  I took this course two terms ago with these folks, and I honestly don't remember anything from it.  I learned nothing, and I know from talking to several of my classmates that many people agree with me.

I found the class as a whole to be really interesting and not very hard.  The class was taught by four different professors, each of whom spent a couple of weeks lecturing on their specific area of expertise.  Heatherton and Hughes were the best.  The lectures were very interesting.  There are only four tests and a final, all of which are multiple choice and graded on a curve, so it's very possible to get a good grade if you study a little.  There is no homework except for reading the book.  It is rare to find an intro class that is so exceptional.

psych1 was really interesting for me.  psych1 is the quintessential intro class.  kleck is the man.  hughes is also the man.  clark is fine -- makes things simple and clear, but is not very captivating.  heatherton is pretty good -- more interesting than clark, but not as strong as kleck and hughes.  do the t-points.  don't let the multiple choice exams turn you off to the class.  definitely do all the readings.

Generally speaking, this was an effectively taught and interesting course.  It was obviously a large lecture class, but I found that sitting in the front of the auditorium made it seem smaller than it was.  There were four lecturers for the course, each with their own areas of expertise.  Prof. Clark took a biological approach, and her lectures were fairly dry and the material was not all that interesting.  Second, Prof. Hughes, the Perception prof. was a highly animated and engaging lecturer.  I would recommend him strongly for this course and others.  Third, Prof. Heatherton, with an emphasis on child development, lectured engagingly, however too quickly.  He tried to cram too much material onto the Power Point slides.  Last, Prof. Kleck, the course chair, held some remarkably cogent and satisfying lectures.  He went with the old-school overhead projector and transparencies and accompanied these with an engaging style of lecture, very often adding anecdotal tales and drawing comparisons to Dartmouth itself.  I would highly recommend Kleck for this course and others!  Two thumbs up for this go-round of Psyc 1.  Definitely a course to take while at Dartmouth, since it is so applicable to real world situations.

I loved Psych 1.  I thought it was an extremely interesting class.  That said, some advice  i took this class junior fall when it was filled with freshmen.  all the freshmen ignored the profs on at least the first 4 tests.  the profs said over and over that 90% of the questions would be taken from our text and might not have been mentioned in class.  the freshmen continued to skim the test the night before the tests. this is NOT a good strategy.  instead, try to spend a little time reading every night.  there is no way you can read all 200 pages in one night.  i would also recommend getting the study guide.  reading the book in segments and filling out the study guide in the 3 nights before the test completely prepared me.  i never went over the material more than once and was able to remember the answers when they were presented on the tests.  that said, the tests are multiple choice, this format doesn't work for everyone.  some people recall information when they see the answer choices and others confuse themselves.   i loved the class but you've got to be ready to put the time into the reading and the study guides.  in addition, the class was team-taught by 5 profs so each person presented the material in their part of the field.  this made for interesting and dynamic lectures.

Overall this is a simple intro class, however watch out for which professors are going to be teaching and ask people who know the psych professors before you sign up.  Professors Kleck and Heatherton were very good lecturers, while Prof Clark's lectures were more in following with the book and tended to be dry.  Prof Hughes's sarcasm oftened bordered on suggesting disinterest and his lectures weren't necessarily filled with useful information i.e. "Well this isn't really my specialty, but here's a picture of a cat humping a dog."

If you're interested in psychology, the material should be interesting enough to keep you going throughout the term.  The profs are all different; Jernstedt is an interesting and effective lecturer, whereas Grafton seemed a little out of place in the classroom.

aight. psychology is one thing, and psych 1 is another. I guess I'm not a multiple choice test person, so I didn't do so well in this class. But I did put in a considerable amount of time into this class, but my grade doesn't reflect it at all. I don't know what I could recommend for this class. It's really easy for some and difficult for others like me. If you can do 200 pages of reading in a couple of weeks and retain all the important concepts and terms in it, you'll be fine. I was a slow reader, and it didn't help it in any way.

The lectures, while usually interesting (especially with Jernstedt), were not too useful exam-wise. Definitely take this class, you'll learn a lot that you can apply to other classes. The exams are all multiple choice, with usually 35-40 of the 50 questions from the reading, and not covered in lecture. The text is about 850 pages long, expect to read it cover to cover during the term. The book, while dry sometimes, is generally not too bad. I'd give this class an A-/B+.
@

This class is definitely a weeder class. there is a ton of reading (that isn't always so interesting) and the tests ask questions about specific details of the reading. if you are incredibly interested in psych then it's a good class. if you are looking for a soc credit... there are better ways to get it. either way you can still enjoy the lectures of jernstedt and macrae who are excellent profs.

The material in Psych 1 is really interesting and the prof's are all really funny and some of the best profs in the dept taught this course.

This course was so interesting!  I loved the material that we covered and actually enjoyed reading my psychology book.  The lectures were also very thought-provoking, and it was neat how four different professors taught the class about their specialty area of psychology.  My one complaint about the course is the multiple choice tests.  We had four tests and one final that were each worth 20% of the course grade and that consisted of 50 multiple choice questions.  I had an awful time trying to figure out these tests and struggled throughout the entire choice trying to improve my multiple choice skills.  It was unfortunate that all of what we learned in a unit was tested by just 50 questions.  I would highly recommend this course to anyone, however those of you who are missing the multiple choice part of your brain, be warned!  The tests are tough!

All the profs are great, but Prof Kleck and Prof Jernstedt have exceptionally interesting things to say.  Some of the exams were harder than others, though.  Overall, this is a great course and I think everyone should take it.

The material was really interesting. Things to note 4 Professors teach this class.  Prof. Jernstedt was an interesting lecturer, but his exam was over irrelevant and minute details.  Kelley was pretty straightfoward.  Heatherton is an interesting lecturer, and I thought he was a good teacher up until I took his exam, which sucked.  He is the author of the new textbook, and his pride over that fact definitely appeared on his test.  I really liked Kleck. He knows exactly how to get you interested in the course.  I thought it was a good course overall and incredibly interesting.  But the exams are very tough, but I really wouldn't waste your time studying too hard for them--if you at least read you should get a B-.

Prof. Heatherton is an author of the book; he knows his stuff, but is a dry lecturer. Prof. Kleck is very dry, but his exam was by far the most difficult.  Warning This is not a gut course.   You should plan on attending every class.

I was surprised by this course because it turned out to be fabulous! Most people would expect intro courses to be boring, but this one was not.   Even if you're not planning on being a major, take it... it's great! And make sure you do the t-point experiments!

this class is a ton of work.  the amount of reading per night is enormous, and you have an exam basically every 2 weeks. however, the class is curved and there are extra credit opportunities.  if you have any interest in psychology, take this course.  if you are just looking for an easy class that you will always skip, you might want to find something else.

This class is really interesting and potential psych majors will love the material but may be discouraged by their grade. Yes, the first 5 or 6 psych classes you'll take will be multiple choice like this one and somewhat frustrating to do well in, but then the upper levels involve more papers and projects and it's easier to get the grade you deserve. Overall, this is a good introduction to psychology and to some of the profs you will have in future classes if you continue.

all the tests are based on the reading, which is interesting but long.  there are no papers and only multiple choice tests, so if you can study tons of text, you are set.

The course is, as it says, a survey course. It covers a lot of material in a pretty short time. This can be tough, especially if you get behind in the reading. Unlike high school courses, it is really expected that you learn the material on your own out of class; the readings comprise 75% of each exam. I certainly recommend this course, but only if you're prepared to read and spend time learning the material on your own. The professors were excellent, and having four different professors was exciting.

Psyc 1 manages to introduce you to the breadth of pyschological knowledge while also remaining very interesting and relevant.  You will immediately make connections to your everyday life, and you will enjoy attending lectures as the professors are effective lecturers who welcome questions (impressive in a class of 200) and who utilize various media like movies, graphs, and segments from TV shows to demonstrate their points.  The exams are all multiple choice.  If you are good with multiple choice tests, you will most likely do especially well on the exams.  The exams do tend to focus on some specific details from the reading though; so you will have to read conscientiously.  The psychology textbook is probably the best textbook I've every read, and I enjoyed reading most of the chapters.  The class involves very little, if any, stress.  Everyone should take this class.  We are all human beings, and the course studies the dynamics of human cognition and behavior.  Four professors teach the couse, and each teaches a two-week unit.  My professors were Grafton, Clark, Hull, and Kleck.  They were all excellent, especially Kleck who is open and not afraid to say controversial things in class.  Some of his comments were hilarious.

However, if you are not planning on taking more classes in the Psychology department, I'm not sure that this is the most worthwhile class to take since almost all of the material was taken from the book.  There were some interesting lectures, but not enough extra material to justify taking this as a class rather than just reading the book.  I do advise everyone to read the book, though.
@

Psych 1 is a great introductory class.  The material is really interesting, and if you don't like one part of it, the topic switches every two weeks.  It's a great way to experience the many different facets of psychology.  There's a good amount of reading involved, but as long as you keep up with it, you'll do fine on the tests.  The exams are truly a fair representation of how much time you put into attending lectures and doing the reading.  An added bonus is that you'll actually be learning things that you can apply to your every day life - such as why people act the way that they do and why you respond the way that you do.  I highly recommend this class.

This is the basic intro to psych.  Its great to have it mixed up with 4 different profs.  All of them have their strengths and weaknesses.  This is a good basic class.  And take advantage of those T-points!

This class was very interesting, and I think it would be for just about anyone who took it.  There was a great amount of material covered throughout the term, but lectures and readings were effective in helping me learn the material.  The tests were pretty difficult but fair.  Overall, I'd say Psych 1 is a great course.
@

The profs over all presented engaging lectures on interesting material although somedays were particularly boring. The book was extremely dry and 75% of the test questions were from the book. Definitely buy the study guide as it will help immensely with the exams. Do the reading and spend most of your time memorizing all the information in the 4-5 chapters on each exam plus the lectures, which would explore very minor points presented in the book or aspects of psych not in the book at all. The final covered the entire book. The class is graded on a strict bell curve with the median set a B/B-. There are extra credit point opportunities but 8 hours of volunteering for psych experiments will only boost your grade from B to B plus.  If you take this class, be prepared to do a lot of memorizing or put an NRO on it.

Psych 1 is an introductory course.  As long as you read the book and attend at least 75% of the lectures, you'll earn a good grade.  The exams are mostly based on the reading.

the course is pretty good.  it's divided into four sections, each with a different prof.  prof kleck is very cool, pleasant, down to earth.  prof clark is a good lecturer, but very egotistical and hard to work with outside of class.  i had some real problems this term, and she was highly unaccommodating, even at the urging of the dean.  the other two profs are fairly average.  so, psychology good.  ann clark bad.  steer clear.
@
Robert Kleck
/course/2477
the topics we covered in this class were very interesting--i'm really happy that i took the class!   the class is split into a tag-team system of profs... each prof teaches their 4-5 chapters for two weeks, and then you take a test based on their lectures and the textbook readings.  the only problem is that with this set-up, you can get way behind in teh readings...like i did... and then get stuck reading 5 psych chapters for two days straight before a test... don't do that!!  stay on top of the reading!!  at the end of the term, you have a fourth test on 5 chapters of reading, and then, immediately afterwards, a final on everything you've learned.  although the tests are not hard if you've done the readings for class, it always helps to have gone to lectures... about 5-10 questions per test (and each test is only 50 questions) are taken from lecture.    over all, a good class, especially for one of its size.  i definitely reccommend taking it.

I sure was relieved to know that there were four different professors teaching this class....and don't worry, they get better as they go along. If you think you have any interest in how the human mind works, take this class.  It is a good introduction to psychology.... overall the professors are good, the material is usually interesting because it has to do with what you think and if anything, you will come away with a better understanding of yourself and others.  You will have to suffer through some pretty boring lectures at first though. As for work, at first, it seems like a lot of reading, but it turns out to be very managable,as long as you keep up.

Four different professors each taught their own section in this course.  I thought this was a good idea because it added some variety.  The only drawback was some of the professors were not as good.  Their lectures were very monotonous.  On the other hand, the last professors were great.  Their lectures were very interesting.  The continuous switching of professors was a good change throughout the course.
@

Psych 1 was a really interesting course.  I mean, who wouldn't want to know how the human mind works?  I think everyone should take it.  It's not that hard and the information is very applicable to real life.  It's nice to take a class that's not all irrelevant details, where you can see that what you're studying is important.  This course is taught by 4 profs (for this section it was Clark, Scott Grafton, Jay Hull, and Robert Kleck).  I liked it because if one prof was boring you weren't stuck with them for long.  But that, combined with the size of the class, meant that I never got to know any of the profs.  Hull and Kleck gave by far the most interesting lectures.  Clark wasn't bad, Grafton was pretty boring.  All except Kleck posted their power point lectures on Public, but class was usually interesting so I wouldn't recommend sleeping through it.  Tests are all multiple choice.  The lectures often don't have much to do with the text, but it's important to read the text because 80% of the test is on the reading.  You can get extra credit in the class for participating in grad students' psychological experiments, which is sometimes fun.  Sometimes they pay you too.
@
Robert Kleck
/course/2477
realize that if you take this course you have to adjust to the lecture styles of not one but four profs and they are each different.  the reading was really interesting but there was a TON of it and the tests are mostly on the reading not the lectures.
@
William Kelley
/course/2477
It depends on which professors you get, but personally, I only intensely enjoyed Prof. Wheatley's lectures, which reflected the reading but expanded on certain things. Her exams were also a fair evaluation of the reading and the lectures. Other profs were not as great... Kelley showed Youtube videos the entire time, Bucci was not too great at explaining some really basic neuro, and Kleck lectured entirely outside of the reading, then gave an exam in which 40/50 questions were from the reading.  If I didn't enjoy the reading so much, I would be a lot less happy with this course. I had never taken psychology before so I really enjoyed the text. Do your T-Points early, they raise your grade a whole third (eg. B+ to A-). The exams are mainly easy (if you're good at multiple choice), but are curved harshly so you always have to study a lot to get the grade you want.   So not exactly an easy third, but still worth taking!
@
William Kelley
/course/2477
Course Psyc 1 is a necessary evil, but for an introductory course it's not too bad.  Professor I personally liked Bucci's style of going by the book and delivering clear lectures. Wheatley also gave great lectures. Kelley is all over the place, but keeps class interesting. Kleck is good as well, but just not as engaging as the others in my opinion.  Workload Read the book and use the study guide.

of the professors were REALLY boring. This class was taught by 4 professors, and 2 of the 4 continually put me to sleep, despite their own psych advice on staying awake. More work than i thought because chapters for each section are loong.

Compared to other science classes, this is more of a conceptual class. The tests are very basic and relatively simple if you attend all the lectures and do the readings; of course, the tests have to be 'simple' in terms of having straightforward questions because there is a whole lot of material to learn (an entire textbook, plus whatever professors cover in their lectures). Some of the experiments we heard about were very interesting, and it helps that we can participate in experiments for extra credit. The course was taught by four different professors, each in 2-2.5 week sections, with a test after each section and then a comprehensive final at the end. Each professor was amazing - highly recommended.

Alright, on the whole this course is pretty awesome.  You learn a lot of really really interesting things, and most of the class sessions are filled with really cool demos.  It is a VERY tough course, more difficult than you expect.  The lectures are fun and interesting, but worthless as far as learning and the tests go.  The entire meat of the course is in the book, so expect to be doing a lot of reading, or you will be screwed, cause the Profs don't really cover much material at all... it kind of sucks and is one of the biggest drawbacks to the course... the learning is mostly independent.  However, if you do the reading it's not bad, the book is actually interesting.  My tip  The thing that helped me out the most and made me do much better on the tests was using the book's website.  If you take the post-test and tutorial quiz on the website it will help you a lot.

This course is taught by 4 different professors each covering different areas of psyc - Prof. Kelley, Prof. Jernstedt, Prof. Groh, and Prof. Kleck.  With the exception of Prof. Groh, the profs were very good.  They didn't attempt to cover all the information in the textbook (which you need to know for the tests), but instead presented the most interesting information in the lectures (which was a good thing in my opinion).    The tests are a little harder than you'd expect, but if you read the textbook thoroughly and go to class, it's not too bad.

first, the review  very easy, especially if u like multiple choice tests. very interesting too. the class is taught by a succession of 4 profs, 1 for each subject area, so some ppl find a section more or less interesting than the others.   PSYCH 1 STUDY TIPS 4 SLACKERS  1. read ONLY the summaries at the end of the chapter. they're like 1 or 2 pages long and this is is ALL u need to do for the reading. chapters are long and, unless ur especially interested in that particular subject topic, rather boring.  2. u don't need 2 go to all the classes (this will bcm obvi in like 2 minutes). especially neuropsych if u find it massively boring, as did i, she's just summarizing the reading.    godspeed.

This class was AMAZINGLY INTERESTING but RIDICULOUSLY DIFFICULT!  This is NOT the class you want to take if you do not perform well on multiple choice tests.  The chapters are the longest things EVER!!! I spent too many hours reading, outlining, going over to get below par grades.  You will learn and most likely enjoy both class and the profs, but the exams are killer and it moves WAY to quickly!  Audit the class or NRO it! (unless you do incredibly well on MC tests, then good luck!)

The class was fairly good. It was intro to psychology. That basically sums it up, from a material perspective. You cover a broad spectrum of material, from behavior psychology, learning psychology, brain anatomy, etc. The class has 4 sections with 4 separate professors. Don't be fooled, as many people have been in the past, by the fact that Bill Kelley is listed as the professor for this class; he is just the course chair and teaches only 2.5 weeks, just like the other 3 sections.  The class starts off with Jernstedt, who was a very knowledgeable professor. He definitely knew his stuff and he teaches well. Since it is about learning, it is fairly useful to your life, so it isn't a waste. The second section was Kelley, who taught the section on memory. The classes were very fun and though you learned the least in this section, you learned it well and was a blast. Seriously, it involved the Price is Right and playing DDR. The third section was taught by Groh, who was, bar none, the worst professor I've met at Dartmouth so far. Even though she seems like a very nice woman, she has no idea how to teach. My problems with her range from the basic, like writing on the board with the lights in Filene (where this class is always taught) dimmed to the point where no one can read what she is writing. Other problems would were that she dropped technical terms without realizing none of us knew what they meant and then defining it at the end of the lecture when someone finally asked her. She has a tendency to overcomplicate things (she said the tastes we have were salty, sweet, bitter, sour and umami, which she threw in there solely to confuse us, since it was not asked on any subsequent exam). The review for the exam was awful since the "review sheet" were her lecture notes, which were undecipherable, in that they were clearly written for a PhD to lecture off of. Basically, she was a horrendous professor. The course wrapped up with Kleck, who was a fantastic professor. He has been at the college for forever and is incredibly knowledgeable.   The exams are all 50 questions, roughly 70% straight from the text, rest from the lectures, which really devalues going to class, but that's what it is. They are fairly hard, but are curved, so you'll be OK. There is also extra credit (T-points) which basically means you get credits for participating in psych experiments (MRIs or experiments). Do all 8 hours and you get boosted up half a letter grade. Basically it's a good class, but not a typical intro class.

This course was taught by four profs Jernstedt, Kelley, Groh, and Kleck. Prof. Groh's lectures were straightforward and unimaginative, but effective. The other three professors really seemed to get into lectures and make a lot of effort to make them interesting, different, and exciting. It was like they were all thinking, "it's just Psych 1, let's have a good time." Like, Prof. Kelley had a girl play DDR during class. Maybe it just seemed like these three were really entertaining and Prof. Groh was dry and boring because it's a lot harder to make the physical study of the brain interesting than studies of behavior, etc. Overall, the lectures are usually interesting, the book sucks (I didn't read much of it, which is not the best idea), and it's kind of weird to have your grade in a class based entirely on five multiple-choice tests.

Psychology one is an interesting clas overall. Taking it your freshman fall probably isn't a good idea though. I did, and I do not regret it, but if I had known how it was going to be, I probably would not have done it.  There are four professors, all with different styles of teaching. The grading is quite sketchy and the class is huge. But, OVERALL it is a good course and it serves as a basis for all over psychology courses. I am thinking about double majoring and psyc being one of my majors. But, if psychology is not in store for you, you probably should NOT take this course.

Four different people teach this course in two week segments.  This is good in case you dont care for one of the proffesors, but it does make test taking a little harder since all the tests differ.  All the prof's are good teachers but some of the lectures do tend to get boring and the woman proffesor's tests are by far the hardest.  Since she is first, dont let her test get you down because they get much easier.

Professors don't really teach you much. On average, 25% of the material is from the lectures and 75% is from the book. Profs(4) varied from pretty good to very boring.  If you are a diligent reader, you'll do fine.  If not, make sure you do experiments to earn t-points for your grade.

Five 50 question, multiple choice tests and four professors = you never have to go to class.  However, some of the professors (Kelley & Heatherton)are quite excellent and make you WANT to go to class (ain't that weird...).  Nights before test days (every other friday) are kinda insane but that's the only day anyone works for this class.  Typical easy intro class (200+ students).  Take it to fill up your schedule with a class you have to go to and work for once every two weeks.

I highly recommend this class. Readings are interesting, and William Kelley is hilarious. If you pay attention during lectures and get a hold of the concepts in the text, you should be fine. Attending class is important, especially in the social psychology section. Tests are multiple-choice, and most of the questions are roughly the same as those in the study guide. Todd Heatherton is good too, but Ann Clark and Yale Cohen were uninspiring.

In this class, expect to read a 680 page textbook (about two 40 page chapters per week), that I found very boring. The material is mildly interesting at best, and the textbook dwells on each topic too long. I found my mind wandering constantly, a problem I only had with Psychology reading. The lectures can be allright, but they relate to only one specific part of the reading. As a result, only 25% of the material on the test was covered in the lecture. Unless you think you want to major in Psychology, I don't recommend this class.

This was a really fun class to attend!!!! The only problem was that exams were 80 percent made up of the readings and often most of the material in the readings weren't covered in class so if you are not used to self teaching for 75 percent of the class then it can be tough. BUT...the lectures were REALLY REALLy fun!!! And all the professors seemed really nice!! Especially Kelley who was just down right hilarious and made the class wonderfully engaging!! I would definitely recommend this course for the non-psych major looking to cover some interesting topics!

The subject itself is interesting, it's a good intro course. The classes are lecture style with powerpoint presentations that are good but don't cover all the material on the exams (4 multiple chioce exams throughout and one cumulative final also multiple choice), make sure to read the textbook! And coming to class is not so important, the profs post all lectures on blackboard and don't say much extra in class, but class is fun with the last two profs (there are 4 throughout hence four exams). The only thing is there are a lot more specifics on the exams than you'd imagine so once again read the textbook! and take the course, it's good fun and not too much work, just reading, but the reading is interesting if you're into the subject (once you get past the chapter on all the brain bio) it's chills.

the in-class portion was very easy. all that happens is a teacher speaks and the students (if they wish) can take notes. every two weeks a new teacher teaches their unit, and its followed by a test. the test is ALL on the reading....without reading the necessary chapters you wont do well.

While I did go to class, for the most part you could get away with not going as long as you read the book.  Nothing is to complicated, there is just a lot of material over a pretty broad spectrum of topics.  The class was taught by four different teachers, each for two weeks with a 50 question multiple choice test at the end of each 2 week period.  As long as you had done the reading, the exams were not to difficult.  It was a good overview and interesting as well.

Psych 1 is tremendous.  I had been waiting a lot of terms to be able to fit this course into my schedule.  It was worth the wait.  The material is very interesting.  Essentially, you get a taste of all that Dartmouth's Psych Department has to offer.  If I had more time left on campus, I would pursue more courses in the Psych Department.  The professors were excellent.  The course is divided up by four professors, each teaching for about two weeks.  I enjoyed all of them and would take courses with them in the future.  There are tons of freshmen in the class.  We spent the first class period explaining the basic structure of the course, including the definition of an x-hour.  At first, they all come to every class and somehow were wide awake by 10am, ready to chat it up with the other freshmen sitting around them.  As the term went on, their enthusiasm adjusted to normal levels, but until then it can get on your nerves.  Also, many of them love to sit in class taking notes on their laptops.  I found the constant sound of typing very annoying, especially when I noticed that most of them were on Blitz or thefacebook.com.     In any case, the course is tremendous and socially is a good way to meet some new people (freshmen) on campus.  I highly encourage taking it.

This was a huge class in which most of the test tested material covered only in the textbook and never in class. This was, however, a very good class. The lectures almost without fail were both fun and interesting, as they focused on specific parts of the wide range of material instead of trying to summarize the whole reading. There was a fair amount of reading, but most of it was interesting and painless. I'm glad I took it.
@

I thought the course was exactly what it purports to be- a survey course of basic psychology.  The class was interesting, but the tests were awful.  They didn't test the students' knowledge of the material, but rather the students' test-taking abilities.  A lot of it was pure luck, since the tests covered a lot of material, and were very hit or miss.  It's kind of ironic since these professors, being psych people, know that not everyone tests well in these mutiple choice settings, yet that was the way they chose to evaluate the students.  The professors should require students to write a paper or something so that their entire grade is not based on 5 multiple choice tests.

Psych one was always pretty entertaining.  I liked heaving a different prof. every 2 weeks.  Lots of reading, and you never really knew what to expect when it came to tests.  It depended on the prof.  It was either really hard or really easy.  Overall, I do recommend the class.

Everyone has a different opinion on psych one.  Some people hate it, others love it, but i've found a common trend.  Everyone seems to like half of it.    The problem with psych one, is it's a pre-req for almost everything else in the psych department.  The department, however, is pretty much divided between social psych classes and neuro-science classes.  Most people tend to be more interested in one of these two areas.  Psych 1, covers both a lot of neuro-science and a lot of social psych.  So, the science kids sit there through the social psych thinking that it's all BS, and the social kids sit there through the neuro-science wondering why on earth they have to learn about "neurotransmitters" and "synapses."    There is a ton of reading, much more than you would expect from an intro class, and it tends to be very dry.  The tests are all 50 multiple choice questions, which I think is very unfair considering the amount of material that they cover.  In addition, psych profs know how to write questions that will trick you and psyche you out, and they tend to take advantage of this....  Don't be too down on the class though.  Some people do find it very interesting.... well, at least one half.  None of the information is HARD to learn, it's just hard to get motivated to do so much dry reading.  While i have not taken anything else in the department, i hear that it gets better from here.  So, dont decided not to be a psych major, just because you heard that psych 1 sucks.

The class is interesting, and the later two proffessors are wonderful, so make an effort to go to those classes - they add a lot to the material.  For the most part though it is basic introduction to psych, meaning that it's essentially just learning an entire textbook of material - lots of reading and memorizing.  Intro to psych is definitely a class that everyone should take at some point if possible.

Well, the beginning of the course was, to me, excruciatingly boring. The biological bases of psychology chapter was extremely dry (scratch that the entire book is quite dry). Perhaps you neuroscience types will enjoy it more than I did, but I was really disappointed at the beginning of the class. The good news is that the class really does get better as it goes (and by "better" I mean "it has more and more to do with social psychology"--and let's be honest, that's what you took the class for). The professors vary in their effectiveness there is a new professor for each of the four units. Kelley himself is the most colorful and unpredictable prof, but his purposeful tangents are admittedly sometimes too off-the-track; some kids didn't come to his classes, regarding them as wastes of time. Yale Cohen didn't seem that knowledgeable, but William Heatherton (the last prof) is excellent. And the first prof (a woman whose name I forget) actually did quite well with some rather boring material. In all, you'll be glad you took the class, as it is the foundation for later, more interesting psych classes, and you'll finally be able to know what you're talking about when you refer to something as 'Freudian'.

Don't need to go to class. Just read.   Classes can be interesting, but are taught by different profs on different weeks. Some profs really suck and you don't learn anything.   If your alarm is going off at 945 and you really really really don't want to get up and go to Psych 1 at 10o'clock....DON'T! sleeping is better than going to this class.

This class is awesome. The material is very interesting and a couple of the professors are make class entertaining. It is not necessary to attend class whatsoever because the powerpoint presentations are all available online after class. Also, the grading curve stinks if you get below a zero for your cumulative Z-score. The key to this class is memorizing the book.

It seems easy, right?  Just read the assigned chapters, go to the lectures if you want, and take the EASY multiple-choice tests.  Wrrrong.    The tests ARE easy.  But that's the catch--you're graded on a curve, against other very bright Dartmouth students.  Just the difference of one question right or wrong can adversely affect where you end up in the curve, since everyone gets such a small range of scores.    So, be careful!  It seems like an easy class, but the test curve makes it so you can't really slack too much.    Also  Everyone else loved Prof. Kelley, it seemed.  I thought he was sub-par, with a tendency to ramble and have disjointed, unplanned lectures.  He spent MOST of his lecture time playing games with the class that had little-to-no relation to the course material and showing us LONG silly movies that he and his TA's made years ago--which also had no relation to the course material.  He's a funny, great guy, but I thought he was easily the worst teacher of the four since his lectures, though fun, were worthless.

There are four profs, and some are better/more interesting than others.  The tests are multiple-choice and largely out of the textbooks so you have to do all the chapter readings.  The workload isn't bad, but it is a large class and all powerpoint lectures.  It could have been more interesting at times.  You can do psychology experiments for extra-credit though and bring up your grade half a mark, even after the curve.

the course is taught by four profs, who each teach a few weeks of the course. i stopped even trying to attend classes after the second prof was as bad as the first (perhaps the last two were better?). lectures are BORING, and only cover part of the reading. some interesting videos. but your time is better spent doing the reading on your own than going to class. check blackboard to learn when tests are, what chapters to read, etc.

The only homework is to keep up with the reading, its a very interesting class, but you have to read. THats what the tests are based on, and you should go to class for the interesting lectures. COurse gets fairer as it progresses and teachers swap to lecture on their prospective fields. Very interesting class if you go to class and do the work.

The course was taught by 4 professors. They were all OK (Clark was pretty boring) but Professor Kelley was awesome. It is a large lecture course so it is kind of hard to pay attention unless you really focus. The material, itself, isn't that difficult but there is a lot of it.  There is a midterm (worth 20% of your mark) every 2 weeks. So pretty much you can slack off and do no reading until the couple of days before the test but it becomes a lot of cramming.  All the tests are multiple choice so learning the material means pretty much memorizing the text.  The class was kind of interesting, but it was nothing special.  If  you skipped class you could still do fine in the course as long as you read the textbook.  Overall, it was a pretty good introduction to psych.
@
William Kelley

A lot of the material was very intersting, and Prof Kelley definitely made the learning part fun. But there is way too much info crammed into the space of one term - annoying, as lots of details have to be learned from the textbook as well.

I really enjoyed the material covered in this course. I enjoyed the interesting videos including footage of famous and fascinating studies that were shown in class. I also liked how an evolutionary perspective for psychology and behavior was given both in the readings and in class. The reading was pretty slow, and you have to do it because the tests are largely based on it. I studied hard for each exam and took good notes, but I was only able to get 42 out of 50 on all the exams. The grades are curved, however. The staff teaches this course, and all of the professors are good.

This course was taught in four different sections, each by a different professor.  The class is pretty big, but the professors were all generally good at giving engaging lectures.   The material is fascinating and the class really sparked my interest in psychology. There are 4 exams, each with 50 multiple choice questions, and a final with 50 multiple choice questions.  The exams questions are mostly from the readings with some from the lectures. The exams are pretty straightforward and fair. The last exam and the final are on the same day, one after the other, which is a little too much.  It would be better if the final was on a seperate day. Overall, the class was enjoyable.

This class was really not taught by just Prof. Kelley (he's the chair of the course). This term it was taught by Ann Clark, Yale Cohen, Kelley, and Todd Heatherton. They were all a little different.   Prof Clark was your typical lecturer. She wasn't boring but she wasn't interesting. Her slides were good, and she brought in some good outside studies.   Prof Cohen had the really meaty scientific stuff, and he was decent at explaining it... sometimes no one in the class had any idea what he was talking about, though.   Prof Kelley was cool. He brought in a lot of interesting stuff, and went really far to make the actual lectures interesting (and interactive). He was also really great about helping out with preparation for the midterm (he was the only one to give a study guide and a review session - no one else had either).   Prof Heatherton was really interesting, too. He used study statistics to make class both really interesting, and to relay information without being bland.   I found that the second half of the course was a lot more interesting and enjoyable. This was definitely due to Kelley and Heatherton over Clark and Cohen, but I think it also had to do with the actual course material.  Basically, for this course, you have to learn on your own from the book and from the lectures. The lectures will focus on parts of the book, but each prof will go into pretty good detail about various studies -- their areas of expertise. The first half of the class is more of the biological basis of psych, and the second half social psych. After each prof teaches for about 2 weeks, they give a 50 question multiple choice test (which is graded on a perfect standard deviation curve) and you won't see them again.

All i can say is go to class. It is really important to pay attention to the lectures as they give you a much better understanding of the reading.  I also suggest finding what text the course is planning on using and reading it before you actually start the class as the readings are sometimes long. study by using the study guide, reading the chapter summeries, and memorizing vocab.  No matter what you are interested in, some of the material in this class you will definitely like

PSYC 1 was not fun. Despite popular belief this course is hard.  MC tests are hard especially when there are 4 different instructors and no opportunity for you to adjust to their testing style.  Additionally, I felt the class was geared towards freshmen, upperclassmen probably would not find this course interesting... too broad.  Take a meatier course instead.

Psychology, if this course is any indication, is an extremely interesting subject. However, I can easily see how a bad teacher could make this course boring. Prof. Kelley especially, but the other professors as well, made it fascinating. His wacky sense of humor keeps one riveted during the classes he teaches. The other professors are just as good at making the material interesting. The exams are composed perfectly, and the somewhat unconventional curve system is just about the fairest thing I could imagine. There's only one thing wrong with this course. There's way, way, way, way too much reading. We're talking like a hundred pages in a tall, wide textbook for each class. (But as it turns out, you don't really have to do all of it. Shhh. Don't tell anyone.)

There is no downside to this course. It was team taught by five brilliant professors, all of whom offered a unique individual contribution to the whole. It was well-organized and the pacing was very reasonable, giving studentâ€™s time to learn, understand and absorb the material. The book was first-rate interesting, well-written, easy to follow, easy to study from. It related perfectly to what happened in class. In addition to the interesting and informative lectures, there were films of famous experiments and various mental conditions that also contributed to learning. Every day, the content was different and always fascinating. It was a pleasure to come to the class and I looked forward to it.  Grading was strictly objective, based on five 50 question multiple choice examinations. Those who dislike multiple choice format or lecture format will dislike this course. There is no opportunity for b.s. here. However, if you want to learn an amazing amount about many different fields and aspects of psychology in quite a short time and be assessed fairly and objectively on your mastery of the material, this is the course for you.

Psyc 1 is team-taught by four profs.; each gives their own test and the final is cumulative (all tests are 50 questions).  If you have the reading done at least two days before each test, and are able to review lightly for two nights, you'll do better than average... just don't leave readings til the night before, bc you'll be cramming way too much info (sometimes unrelated info) at once.  The prof. switch is nice and refreshing.

This class was taught by 4 different profs Cohen, Hughes, Kelley, and Kleck. I rank them in this order Kleck, Kelley, Hughes, Cohen.

There's 4 tests adminsitered after the 2 week section taught by each prof- 50 multiple choice.

Taking this course as a first term freshman was a bad idea. You are tested mostly on the reading, and the Professors change every two weeks.

Unless you feel you have really good study skills already developed.

In order to do well on the exams, you should read the entire textbook.  Its really, really interesting stuff but I've never needed to read an ENTIRE textbook to take the exams.  As a hard science major, take this with a grain of salt.  No assignments, so do the reading. Does well at introducing the expanse of the subject, but it might just be TOO much.

@

/course/2477
This course is not difficult at all if you attend lectures; the teachers have a way of putting on questions that you would have no chance of answering correctly if you do not, so I highly recommend it.  In the text, you really only need to read the bold faced words and then learn the physiology of the brain. Other than that, they really don't ask questions from the book. I highly recommend cramming just before the exam because the amount of information is easily crammable and it will improve your ability to recall it.

This course was hard.  Honestly you shouldnt take it if this is your first term on campus because it is way too much reading too fast.

This class was pretty average - I didn't find it particularly interesting or boring... it was a typical introductory course.  Good class if you're looking to skip a lot of class (although since 5 profs teach this course, you never know which prof will use lecture for Qs on their test and which ones wont)  I found it difficult to be taught by a different prof for each topic -- once you understood how a prof would structure their tests, you had another teacher.  Prof Kelly was awesome... his tests paralleled exactly what he said would be on them -- however, the other profs were a little more unpredictable in the subject material that they tested us on.

The textbook was terrible, the topics were taught in a whirlwind of changing profs and strange digressions, and the tests (especially Heatherton's) were not a good assessment of learning.  But if you're interested in psych or want to major, it's worth taking.  Hughes is funny but gets waaay off topic.  Kelley is funny and a better lecturer but spends lots of time on demos (such as a game of DDR!?!).  Heatherton is a good lecturer but goes too fast and asks absurd, obscure test questions.  Kleck is a great lecturer and presents information not in the book, which is a little annoying for the test but makes his segment very interesting.
@

Read the book and go to class, because most of the questions on the test are on the book.  The lectures dont really overlap with the book very much.

4 multiple choice tests make up your grade. Pretty standard.  Professor Hughes and especially Professor Kelly were really great professors and gave very fair exams.  Professor Kleck was a great lecturer but gave many test questions that were irrelevant to the topics emphasized in class and/or readings, which was frustrating.  Professor Heatherton was a decent lecturer, but gave really really irrelevant test questions and emphasized minutia and trivia, which is incredily silly for an intro course because chances are, I won't remember that kind of stuff beyond the 24 hour study-period for the exam. Comon, he's a psychologist, he should know that.

Psych 1 is that course where you sincerely enjoy going to class everyday at 10 AM and where, when it comes to the reading, you can easily put it off to the side until the weekend before the next exam and have enough time to read, outline, study, and score an easy B+ on the exams.  The course offers interesting material with an easy workload will most likely inspire (as it has to many in the past) people to if not major/minor in psych, to definitely take further classes in the department.  This is the ultimate survey course.  If you've ever wondered what (research, clinical, etc.) psychologists study and what Dartmouth's PBS professors are like, this is a golden opportunity to find out.  You learn about over a dozen topics taught by four different professors (including the Chair this term).  While I expected by mere probability alone one's bound to be amazing and another to be atrocious, all four professors (plus a new professor who acted as a sub one day) were great.  They were all able to engross students in their interesting respective fields.  We laughed, we gasped, and we learned.  BTW, I've heard from a Psych Professor that the fall Psych 1 lineup in comparison to the other terms is stronger than the other terms since that is when the bulk of the Dartmouth students take the course.  While the Winter or Spring term courses may be smaller, classes are purely lecture, so don't expect to benefit from a class of 120 students rather than 170.  The tests are multiple choice, and fairly frequent (spaced roughly 2.5 weeks apart), with three unit tests throughout the term, and then the fourth plus the final cumulative exam during finals week (one unit test per professor).  While some questions can be tricky, most aren't that hard, and at the end of the day, MC tests merely gauge recognition, so you don't have to go as overboard studying as you would for practically every other class you'd take.  As for the textbook, ours was 677 pages, and we were responsible for reading practically all of it.  It's really not that bad, as it is broken up into 1/4 for each test, the book has a lot of pictures (and other fill) and was interesting for the most part.  Anyone who complains about there being too much reading or having to "memorize everything" just isn't used to having to digest so much reading or studying properly for such a test.  Just find a friend, split the chapter assignment in half, and outline the chapters.  Reread the outlines 2-4 times, and the lecture notes, and you're ready.  If the freshmen aren't prepared for this their first term, then oh well, at least they help the curve for those of us who are.  -P

Bottom line  -Interesting material -Enthusiastic professors -Great textbook -Fair tests  General points -Having four professors (and a corresponding four units) was refreshing and provided a great introduction to the PBS dept. -Quite a few of the test questions could be tricky.  The key is simply to do the reading, and then retain the details until the test. -This class was not stressful---definitely a great third course, provided you're willing/have time to sit down and read 4-5 chapters before the exams.  So, it's great for freshman year or when your other two courses are tough.

You have to take this class to take most other psyc classes at Dartmouth, so it's kinda a necessary evil. The subject matter they try to cover in a single quarter is WAY too much and while its good to get such a broad base of psyc and an idea of what all the different areas are about, it was just a ridiculous amount of info. Plus multiple choice tests suck and don't rest what you really learned at all! But, you do get four different teachers who are all good, and it was fun class. So if you have any interest in psyc, take it!

These professors are great lecturers. I liked Jernstedt and Hughes best but I know a lot of people like Wheatley a lot too. The material is very interesting.   The downsides are a lot of reading that you have to do  if you want to do well. The reading is usually at least somewhat interesting if not very interesting, but it is a textbook.   The other downside is that your grades are measured in comparison to other students. There are 4 multiple choice tests (one for each prof) and then a final that you take on the same day as your last multiple choice.   If you're comfortable with multiple choice, prepared to do some reading and are interested in the subject I recommend taking it. I feel like I learned a lot of useful information.

The professors for this class are all GREAT!  The material is VERY interesting.  The lectures are not boring at all!  The one thing that wasn't good about this class was the testing and grading format.  The professors gave lectures on material they wished to cover; however, the exams covered the readings from the textbook as well as the lectures.  The textbook is VERY dense and you should really try to keep up with the reading throughout the class, so you're not stuck reading it all (4-5 chapters) the night before the exam.  Sometimes the reading can be a bit dry, especially when it covers the more biological topics rather than psychological (but hey, maybe that's just me).  The multiple choice on the exams were a bit tricky, but again, if you read and know your stuff, you should be fine.  Just make sure you keep up with the reading!  I can't stress that enough!  Also, do the T-point experiments early in the course.  It's so much better to get it over with early.  Plus, doing all 8 bumps you up one step in grading.

Psych 1 provides a very useful viewpoint -- many very useful viewpoints, in fact -- for understanding people's thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors. Don't take this just for a distrib (although you can do so if you want to, I suppose); take it for your own benefit.  There is a lot of reading. Depending on the professor, some or none of the material will be addressed in lecture. The structure of the class is kind of intimidating -- with the curve; with the five 50-question multiple-choice tests; with the textbook that we have to finish, regardless of what each professor actually wants to teach. Many students and even professors find the format a bit unsettling. Nevertheless, you can earn extra credit, and the material is priceless.

I never took Psych before and I found myself deeply engaged with almost every subject we covered in class.  I learned a lot of information relevant to my life, and most of the lectures were incredibly interesting.  Jernstedt was awesome and I hope he isn't retiring...Hughes, Wheatley, and Whalen were all great lecturers and it just shows how star-studded the Psych department is here.  I just wish the tests didn't cover information strictly from the textbook cuz reading that before each test was a pain....but since I did the tests were all pretty simple.

the class is very interesting, but it's pretty tough to get a good grade, so i would definitely recommend using the NRO. the reading takes FOREVER and the tests are all multiple choice, which can be a little tricky.  it's a good class to have if  you have other tougher classes because all it is is reading.

I loved this class. It was so interesting and it was great to have 4 different professors come in to teach the sections that they knew best. it offered a variety of teaching styles which was cool and a little refreshing throughout the term. the testing is a little eh, but the class was so worth it. i recommend it for anyone even if you're not a major, especially if you can get it with these profs because they were awesome!

This was one of my favorite courses.  The material was very interesting and the professors made it even more so, especially Jernstedt.  I tend to zone out during lectures, so I was very surprised to find myself paying attention to every minute of class.  The textbook isn't bad, although there is a lot of material to learn.  There are four fifty question multiple choice tests, and each one is on four chapters, except for the last one which covers three chapters.  If you study everything in the book and attend lectures you will be fine on the tests; they're not easy but they're the sort you can prepare for.  Plus you get extra credit for participating in experiments--an easy way to boost yourself a letter grade.  I highly recommend this course!

YOU MUST TAKE THIS CLASS. I loved it. It made me want to major in psych! Every lecture was meaningful and well prepared and I loved coming to class. Curving tests kind of sucks, and I didn't like the amount of random material that we had to learn by ourselves.  Even if you don't do well, this class will help you understand your own life a lot more and help you with study habits.

I've never had to read a text book cover to cover before.  Maybe everyone else has but that was a new one for me, and since the final was based only on the textbook readings (and 70% of each other test weas as well)the reading was kind of necessary.  But its an interesting subject and the professors give really good lectures.
@
G. Christian
/course/2477
If you start doing your readings on the first day of class, and start your second set of readings the day after the first test, you can do well in this class. The readings are pretty interesting, so it's not a huge pain to get the readings done.  The lectures are awesome. I enjoyed every lecture because of how interesting the teachers and subject are.  One thing it's kind of hard to get above the curve in this class. The material is easy, but that just means that everybody does pretty well on the exams so the curve is generally really high. This makes it really hard to keep up with the top group of students in the class, although it's not too hard to keep up with the average students.

The course attracted me because I wanted something easy that I could let be my 3rd course and I was wondering what psych would be like. However, this course was exactly what i do not like, the multiple choice were terrible because the tests slam you. It is a course designed so that people have to fail not matter what in comparison to their peers. I would feel bad doing well or poorly on a test. I felt like I had no control over my grade no matter how much I studied. The textbook os the hole course it in impersonal and not owrth it unless you need it to major. i would not do it it is the worst course I have had at Dartmouth.

The tests are multiple choice 35 book questions, 15 lecture questions (approximately); there is a weird curve, so you never really know what your grade is until the end.  Professor Jernstedt had well organized, interesting lectures and he clearly made an effort to entertain/interest the students. He did not put slides on Blackboard, but he did give study guides out for every couple of classes.  Professor Kelly was a little unorganized, but extremely entertaining, and related most of the material to drinking beer and as he called it "licking people you think are yummy". He gives you a study guide of questions before his exam to help you study -- its VERY helpful.  Professor Whalen clearly thinks highly of himself and it is obvious in his lectures that he thinks he is amazing. I found it extremely difficult to focus during his classes. He posts his slides online, but they are mostly pictures and diagrams without much explanation, so you still need to go to class.  Professor Heatherton goes straight from his slides and puts them on Blackboard for you to study. He is friendly and was a decent lecturer. He often let class out early (especially on Fridays) because he speeds through his slides.

I really liked this class. All the profs were really good and you could tell that they were very passionate about their subject matter. Make sure you read the book and don't fall behind. The tests are 85% book, 15% lecture. The worst part about the class is the curve. They curve down and base your grade on your percentile. Take advantage of the t-points. They can be a pain, but they boost your grade.

The profs are nice.  Each have a different style but tell you what to expect.  For a person who is not a fan or good at multiple choice exams, this was rough.

NRO'd the class because I was interested in the material but didn't want to stress about doing well on the tests. Tests were combinations of lectures and reading--if you want to do well, you have to both go to class and read. The classes are very interesting though so it isn't too hard pulling yourself out of bed to go. The tests are based on a strict curve so you have to get within a certain percentile of the class if you are aiming for a certain grade. T-points (volunteering for psych experiments) are an easy way to pump the grade up though.
@
G. Christian
/course/2477
For an introductory course, this course is taught extremely well. The professors do a very good job of explaining their own particular topic, and then passing it off to the next professor. It is also great to hear from all of them; as a result, you get to hear from someone who is working in the field of study that the class is exploring at that time.

i mean it's psyc 1...it's such a general survey class with horrible multiple choice tests. but if you want to be a psych major and you have no choice but to take it..just suck it up and read the textbook. good news is, after psyc 1, no other psyc class is as general and as broad. no way to really study for mc test except to memorize textbook.
@
G. Christian
/course/2477
the class is really interesting and these four profs were EXCELLENT. but take this as an easy third class if you're good at multiple choice, because that's what determines your grade.  4 profs = 4 50-question exams, plus one 50-question final.
@
G. Christian
/course/2477
It was interesting material but it convinced me that I don't want to major in this topic. The department is large and the classes are huge, so you end up just a face. The profs didn't inspire any huge passion in me for the subject. It's hard having 4 different profs, it was interesting to hear about their research but it would be better to have one consistent prof. The tests were frustrating since something like 35 out of 50 questions were from the book, so the lectures didn't count for much. It's a nice intro/dabbling, but don't expect any epiphany.
@
G. Christian
/course/2477
Jernsted, hughes (funny guy), and heaherton where good profs. The last proh, Groh, was boring and I didn't really go to her class lectures thus the 80% attendance I had. Overall It's not a hard course. Just have to read all the chapters and study and you're set. Some people say the multiple tests are hard but I felt they were ok. One thing I recommend to all of you...always check if the textbook has a website because psych 1 usually uses exam questions that come with the book. In my case, I saw a lot of the quiz questions on the textbook's website on the class exams. Only thing, they do change the textbook every year and not all these publishers have good websites.

Interesting material, lots of text reading.  class had four different profs, some much better than others (jernstedt being the most effective in my opnion)... pretty much your basic intro course, with only four 50 mc tests + final to determine your grade. tests can be rough, but extra credit helps!  making study groups help A LOT too, definitely worth finding people to study with.  overall fun and interesting class, haven't found anyone that didn't like it.

This class was definately worth taking.  Be aware that there is a lot of reading and that the reading is necessary, but if you do the reading you will do very well in the class.  The professors were great, with the exception of one who is now teaching at another school, so no worries.  Hughes and Heatherton were two of the other proffesors and both did very good.  I highly recommend this class.
@

Quite possibly the worst course I have ever taken at Dartmouth. It's ridiculously easy, I'm convinced that one doesn't even have to do anything aside from show up to the exams to pass. I've heard this said too. The tests cover 5 chapters each (20 chaps. total). I never found it necessary to read more than the chapter summaries, with one or two exceptions, to grasp as much as I needed to succeed on the exams. The lectures are almost pointless, for the most part only one chapter is covered between exams (although it is covered thoroughly) so the student is responsible for learning most of the material by him/herself. I'm just glad it gets a distrib out of the way.
@
G. Christian

The material is fascinating. The professors are some of the best that I've encountered at Dartmouth. I would recommend that every Dartmouth student take this course. It was that good. And this is coming from a math major. I learned more about myself and other people in this one class than I have in any three other classes. The material is easily applicable to everyday life, covering everything from learning to social interaction to emotions to.... The list goes on.

@

I came into this course with the expectation that it was suppossed to be "the easiest course at Dartmouth" (which I heard from several seniors) -- this is not true. Granted there are no assignments or papers, there is a huge amount of reading and a lot of material to be familiar with for the 4 tests that determine your grade. Its not all that bad, but just dont expect it to be a breeze.  The material is very interesting. I enjoyed some of the readings and interactive lectures.  The four-prof teaching team is a bit awkward. Hull, Clark, and Jernstedt are great. Macrae is not - his lectures consisted of reading directly from the text and putting the text on the powerpoint slides No elaboration, No further explanations, No fresh examples or data. He was extremely diappointing. A waste of my money...

The class itself never gets too in depth in any single topic which makes for shallow understanding.  The information however, is good to have when taking upper level psych classes.  Be sure to attend class.  Each lecturer (there are 4 different ones) has a different policy on what is put on the test in terms of lecture and reading material.  But dont trust what they say.  Students who skipped this class and just did the reading did not do well.
@
Ann Clark
/course/2477
This class was fairly interesting and considering it's an intro level class it did hold my attention pretty well.  However the workload is more than an average intro class because tests are based largely on textbook material, which requires reading a 600+ page textbook cover to cover.  The exams, though all multiple choice, were tricky and the curve didn't raise the grades that much.  Take this class if you need it as a pre-req but not necessarily if you're looking for a third class that will be a breeze.

Psych 1 is a lot of fun!  Four profs taught this course Ann Clarke (neurobiology and abnormal psych), Russell Hughes (learning, sensory processes, perception, and cognition), Todd Heatherton (developmental and personality psych), and Robert Kleck (social psych). All four gave informative, entertaining lectures. The lectures were very different from the readings, which was nice because it exposed us to many different topics and viewpoints in psychology.   There were five multiple choice exams, all of which weighed equally into the final grade. Each prof gave an exam for his/her portion of the course. The fifth exam was cumulative (and very easy).  The fourth and fifth exams were taken together during finals.  The other three were taken at two week intervals throughout the term. We read four 30-40 page chapters in the textbook for each exam. The readings were easy and interesting, but also time-consuming. The exams were entirely multiple choice, covering information from the textbook and lectures. We had an hour to complete fifty questions. No one struggled to finish on time. The exams are very easy if you complete the assigned readings and attend the lectures. Just take your time and read the questions carefully.   Students can participate in enjoyable psych experiments for extra credit (T-points). If you receive the maximum 8 T-points (for 8 hours of experiments), your grade will increase by one step (eg. B+ to A-). Fewer than 8 T-points may also increase your grade, depending on your number of T-points and where you lie on the curve. It is very easy to earn all 8 T-points, and most students choose to do so. This converts the exam median grade of B-/B into a final median grade of B or B+.   Take this class! You'll love it!

Okay I took this course as a junior when I really didnâ€™t need it.  I thought the class would be interesting, and it was, I love the lectures, but the grading process for this class sucks.  Everyone told me not to take, mostly because the multiple choice tests were killer, but I did anyway.  I found the tests ridiculously tricky and not a true measure for the work I was going in the course.  The class is taught by 4 profs and the only interesting one I got was Kleck.  If I hadnâ€™t NROed the course Iâ€™d be so upset right now

This class was a great introduction to psychology.  The stuff was interesting, and all four professors were engaging and knowledgeable.  The tests are based almost entirely on the reading, so you have to keep up with the chapters because tests are every two weeks.  Not too difficult.

This course covers pretty much a little of everything in the field of psychology.  You end up reading the entire 700 page textbook during the 10 week course.  The material is very interesting, but the way in which you learn it is tedious and boring.  The lectures are pretty unnecessary considering the tests are mostly on textbook material.
@
Ann Clark

This class was interesting but the tests were terrible.  there were 4 tests during the term, based 90% from the text book and 10% from lecture- why should we even take the class?  I could have passed from memorizing and reading the book and why would anyone want to do that?  The final covered the entire text book (all 17 chapters) and none of the lecture material.  That stunk. I expected more from dartmouth, which prides itself on TEACHING.  Also, the tests are all multiple choice and designed to screw with your mind.  If you're even remotely bad at multiple choice, dont take this class- it's totally not worth it.  NOT an easy A.  and not even worth taking when you're not in it for an easy A.   stinks to be psych majors if ya have to take it- they should seriously look at re-designing the course.
@
Ann Clark

The tests are all multi-choice and the quetsions from the tests are pretty much all from the text.  The chapters can be dense at times, but this is not that difficult of a class.  Plus you can do extra credit and automatically raise your grade.

Psyc 1 ran the gamut of psychology topics, and as a result, not much depth was avaliable for any topic. However, the class works well to introduce you to all the different aspects of psychology, and it helped me determine which types of subjects I'd like to study in higher level classes. The textbook we used was unbelievably boring, but relatively easy to read. The tests were simple multiple choice questions, and you'd do well if you read all the chapters and did a few practice questions on the website. It's pretty simple. Although a lot of people routinely skip classes, I recommend going to class and listen because sometimes the lectures are very thought provoking and will intrigue you. In addition, about 1/4 of the test questions are from lectures, and belive me, it'll help you a lot if you go. We had four teachers. Clark was ehhh, just regular, nothing special, she covered a lot of the nitty gritty areas, though, like brain function and types of drugs and such. Hughes was terrible - constantly went off topic and lost track of what he was saying, not that any of it was important anyway, except of course the only thing I got out of those two weeks - lateral inhibition. Nice guy though. Heatherton was my favorite, his lectures were extremely interesting, and he related to the students best out of all of the teachers. And he showed lots of videos, including a 10 minute montage of When Harry Met Sally on Valentine's Day. Nice touch. I definitely want to take a class with Heatherton again. Kleck was also very good - he's got the most experience and he's probably the best lecturer. His topics were interesting as well, but not as personal as Heatherton's (e.g. Kleck spoke about obedience, Heatherton spoke about relationships). Kleck is a little intimidating, both intellectually and physically, and he's a bit out of step with the students, but all in all the positives way out weigh the negatives. I'd also like to take a class with him again. All in all, easy class if you read. And interesting at times too. (though it felt like 4 different classes b/c 4 different teachers.)

A nice intro course.  The rotating profs each make efforts to make their portions interesting.  It's a little deceptive though-- while the material is generally easy and the workload is light (i.e. just the readings and tests), it's not quite a breeze class because of the curve.  They grade strictly by a curve and make the average a "B+ without t-points" which they say is average.  T-points (extra credit) bring just about everyone up to an A-, but that's still not incredible.  It's just kind of deceptive cause you look at it like an easy class you can just read and get that solid A in, but since it's curved you're not really guaranteed that.  Some of the test questions are specifically curveballs, so it's kind of hit or miss if you're going to get them right or the rest of the class will.  Made me kind of masochistic for my fellow man...  All in all very fun and worth it.  Just don't expect it to be *too* easy an A.

The material for this class was extremely interesting, and Kleck and Heatherton were awesome, but it was annoying to do all the readings without any reinforcement in class.  Overall, it is a good survey of the psych department/psych material.  Good class, but annoying readings and not so fun tests.

The course, from what I attended, was pretty good. However the classes themselves arn't very necessary and 80-90% of the material on the exams is based primarily on the textbook.  The exams are all multiple choice questions and you get graded in comparison to your classmates. If your simply not good at multiple choice questions you suffer twice- once by doing poorly and twice when your already bad results are compared to the rest of your class. On the other hand, if you are good in multiple choice questions you will be able to easily succeed in the course. All in all, the course is good because it makes you read an entire textbook, which in turn teaches you about the psychology. The teachers, in my opinion, play a small part in this course.

I took Psych1 because I always thought I was interested in it; however I am not a science person and I believed that there was way too much science in the class.  I also took the course thinking it would be an easy A, but the tests are surprisingly difficult- apparently the teachers expect you to remember every detail of the textbook and lectures.  Only take Psych 1 if you're truly interested in the subject, and watch out for some truly boring profs.

This course is very interesting.  It is taught in 4 sections by 4 different professors, each with their own specialities.  The lectures are all very interesting.  There is a lot of reading, 4 30-40 page chapters every two weeks followed by a test, and it needs to be done.  And the tests can be somewhat nit-picky.  But this course is not overly difficult, and it is interesting and gives a very brief glimpse into the different areas of psychology.

I wouldn't even call this a "course."  The course started off with Scott Grafton (I won't even call him professor, because not once in the entire span of the course did he ever act like one...at best, he was an exam proctor), who would come into class, throw random Magic Eye illusions on the overhead and mumble at the class for half an hour.  Then he'd dismiss "class" 15 minutes early.    Grafton was, by far, the worst professor I've encountered in my entire time at Dartmouth (and I've completed 11 classes at this point).  He had a very disturbing attitude of "let me put up random illusions and mind games and I won't explain their connection to the course material.  if you figure it out, great for you, and if you don't, that's great, too."  Grafton was never available the 3 weeks that he taught class.  He rarely responded to emails and was apparently out of town all the time when he wasn't in class.  Robert Kleck, who taught a portion of the course, and Ann Clark, were very informative and helpful during office hours.  Their portions of the course were bearable.  But at the end of the course, Neil Macrae came in and did nothing but crack jokes about his accent.  He, too, was very unresponsive to student needs and threw on random videos to kill time.  Folks, don't waste $3000+ of tuition for a class where the teacher will come in and throw on random videos and illusions on the overhead to kill time.  I took this course two terms ago with these folks, and I honestly don't remember anything from it.  I learned nothing, and I know from talking to several of my classmates that many people agree with me.

This class was really not taught by just Prof. Kelley (he's the chair of the course). This term it was taught by Ann Clark, Yale Cohen, Kelley, and Todd Heatherton. They were all a little different.   Prof Clark was your typical lecturer. She wasn't boring but she wasn't interesting. Her slides were good, and she brought in some good outside studies.   Prof Cohen had the really meaty scientific stuff, and he was decent at explaining it... sometimes no one in the class had any idea what he was talking about, though.   Prof Kelley was cool. He brought in a lot of interesting stuff, and went really far to make the actual lectures interesting (and interactive). He was also really great about helping out with preparation for the midterm (he was the only one to give a study guide and a review session - no one else had either).   Prof Heatherton was really interesting, too. He used study statistics to make class both really interesting, and to relay information without being bland.   I found that the second half of the course was a lot more interesting and enjoyable. This was definitely due to Kelley and Heatherton over Clark and Cohen, but I think it also had to do with the actual course material.  Basically, for this course, you have to learn on your own from the book and from the lectures. The lectures will focus on parts of the book, but each prof will go into pretty good detail about various studies -- their areas of expertise. The first half of the class is more of the biological basis of psych, and the second half social psych. After each prof teaches for about 2 weeks, they give a 50 question multiple choice test (which is graded on a perfect standard deviation curve) and you won't see them again.

I highly recommend this class. Readings are interesting, and William Kelley is hilarious. If you pay attention during lectures and get a hold of the concepts in the text, you should be fine. Attending class is important, especially in the social psychology section. Tests are multiple-choice, and most of the questions are roughly the same as those in the study guide. Todd Heatherton is good too, but Ann Clark and Yale Cohen were uninspiring.

the course is pretty good.  it's divided into four sections, each with a different prof.  prof kleck is very cool, pleasant, down to earth.  prof clark is a good lecturer, but very egotistical and hard to work with outside of class.  i had some real problems this term, and she was highly unaccommodating, even at the urging of the dean.  the other two profs are fairly average.  so, psychology good.  ann clark bad.  steer clear.

The course started off with Scott Grafton (I won't even call him professor, because not once in the entire span of the course did he ever act like one...at best, he was an exam proctor), who would come into class, throw random Magic Eye illusions on the overhead and mumble at the class for half an hour.  Then he'd dismiss "class" 15 minutes early.    Grafton was, by far, the worst professor I've encountered in my entire time at Dartmouth (and I've completed 11 classes at this point).  He had a very disturbing attitude of "let me put up random illusions and mind games and I won't explain their connection to the course material.  if you figure it out, great for you, and if you don't, that's great, too."  Grafton was never available the 3 weeks that he taught class.  He rarely responded to emails and was apparently out of town all the time when he wasn't in class.  Robert Kleck, who taught a portion of the course, and Ann Clark, were very informative and helpful during office hours.  Their portions of the course were bearable.  But at the end of the course, Neil Macrae came in and did nothing but crack jokes about his accent.  He, too, was very unresponsive to student needs and threw on random videos to kill time.  Folks, don't waste $3000+ of tuition for a class where the teacher will come in and throw on random videos and illusions on the overhead to kill time.  I took this course two terms ago with these folks, and I honestly don't remember anything from it.  I learned nothing, and I know from talking to several of my classmates that many people agree with me.

Definitely my favorite class at Dartmouth so far and maybe even my favorite class ever. It's a lot of textbook reading but I found most of it interesting, and the lectures are incredibly engaging. The examples they use in lectures consist of a lot of mind-blowing study results and a lot of super cool videos. It's all multiple choice but 15 % of your grade is from a group test and there are plenty of extra credit opportunities, so if you are determined to get an A then you will certainly be able to. Take this class!

This class is an easy A if you show up and do the readings. Wheatley and Duchaine are both super knowledgeable about their fields and really good at explaining basic concepts. They talk about their research a lot which is pretty cool. Super interesting material, lectures often include video examples, tests are easy (30 multiple choice each - your grade is 85% how you do individually, 15% how you do after retaking the same test in a group of 4). Show up and pay attention and you'll do fine. Definitely my favorite class at Dartmouth so far.

This was a good class if you are interested in psych. It has a general overview of all the different fields, so you can figure out what you are interested in and taking more specific classes in the future. That being said, there is a lot of reading and fast paced (2-3 chapters covered a week). The tests are based on lecture and textbook, so there is a lot of material to learn and study (there is some overlap b/w the 2 but there are definitely parts that are not repeated). It's a good class if you are willing to put in the work, but you will have to work very hard to get an A.

Great class. Professor Wheatley and Duchaine work like well oiled machines. Very organized and well structured. The slideshows are available on canvas before class. I recommend going through the textbook, making flashcards of the key words, bringing a printout of the presentation slides to class (no laptop policy), joining a study group or having a tutor, doing the extra credit and going to post-exam reviews. Some of those are overkill, but it worked for me. Extra credit either through participating in research studies or writing about journal articles (I have no personal experience with the latter).Optional post-exam reviews during x-hours. Comparable to AP Psych. Very straight-forward, manageable class with a lot of additional resources if need be.

They are both amazing lecturers & are extremely helpful during office hours. Grading was 100% fair. Anyone that complains about this class being "too hard" either A. doesn't have the intellectual ability to survive at Dartmouth (highly doubt this is the case, I believe the admissions office has competent people) or B. doesn't try hard enough. 11/10 would recommend this class if you're willing to put in the work.

I took the class with Professor Wheatley and Duchaine.  Wheatley gave 2/3 of the lectures and Duchaine gave the other third.   Wheatley's lectures were very interesting and fun. Duchaine's lectures were okay.  The course covered some very interesting topics, like what determines intelligence, and what research shows makes people happy.    Getting an A in this class requires a lot of work. The class has no homework, but to get an A in the class you have to read the textbook and do a huge amount of memorization of psychology terms and concepts from the textbook and the slides.  Each quarter of the course consists of 3-4 chapters each of 30 pages full of terms and concepts to be memorized. The class has three tests and a final, which is 50% cumulative and 50% part 4 of the course.  I tried to get by without reading the textbook and got low grades on test 1 and 2.   I read the textbook for test 3, but didn't memorize everything and got an okay grade on test 3.   For the final I memorized a lot more and got a good grade.  Overall I'd recommend the course - just NRO it or expect to spend a lot of time memorizing terms you will probably forget to get an A.

The work for this course is pretty cut and dry. Take good notes during the lectures and textbook readings, and then consolidate it into a Quizlet to study for each test. The course grade is only from 3 tests and a final, so the only times I found myself working hard for the class was the few days before each test. I would recommend finding a group of people you know to alternate textbook chapter notes and to study for each test. The material itself is fairly interesting, but memorization of terms and research are involved. This course can yield an easy B, but you would need to study much harder to get an A.

I took this with Wheatley, Heatherton, Kelley, and Whalen. They are all great! Go to class! If you go to class and spend some quality time reading the textbook, you'll be fine. And class is very interesting, too! It's not quite a layup because you have to put some work it, but if you can put in a good amount of time, you should be fine. This was my "third" class and spent not TOO much time, and I ended with an A. There's also ample opportunity for extra credit (although because they do extra credit, they don't curve).

Amazing course. I took this with Wheatley and Duchaine, and both were amazing profs! Lectures are incredibly engaging and interesting, and the profs know what they are doing! This course is about working smart... they will tell you to read/outline the textbook, which makes this class a heck of a lot more work than it needs to be. Textbook is rarely ever on the tests, but just in case I would read the end of chapter summaries and thats it. The course is 3 midterms and 1 final (all multiple choice) that are basically based solely on lectures. Attend class, pay attention, take good notes, and you will do fine. Ended with an A with these techniques. Overall my favorite class so far. Will definitely be taking more psychology classes in my future. Take this class!!!

finally, a class I looked forward to attending!  even though it was in Filene, i never fell asleep.  lectures were lively and interesting, and i found myself thinking about and applying the readings many times outside of class.  you learn so much...  the profs (there were 4) went in order from least interesting to most interesting.  so did the subject matter, actually.   worst  ann clark then  hughes then  todd heatherton Best  kleck  so, a great, fairly easy class (decent amoung of readings, easy multiple choice tests, just make sure you beat the mean).

Psych 1 is a lot of fun!  Four profs taught this course Ann Clarke (neurobiology and abnormal psych), Russell Hughes (learning, sensory processes, perception, and cognition), Todd Heatherton (developmental and personality psych), and Robert Kleck (social psych). All four gave informative, entertaining lectures. The lectures were very different from the readings, which was nice because it exposed us to many different topics and viewpoints in psychology.   There were five multiple choice exams, all of which weighed equally into the final grade. Each prof gave an exam for his/her portion of the course. The fifth exam was cumulative (and very easy).  The fourth and fifth exams were taken together during finals.  The other three were taken at two week intervals throughout the term. We read four 30-40 page chapters in the textbook for each exam. The readings were easy and interesting, but also time-consuming. The exams were entirely multiple choice, covering information from the textbook and lectures. We had an hour to complete fifty questions. No one struggled to finish on time. The exams are very easy if you complete the assigned readings and attend the lectures. Just take your time and read the questions carefully.   Students can participate in enjoyable psych experiments for extra credit (T-points). If you receive the maximum 8 T-points (for 8 hours of experiments), your grade will increase by one step (eg. B+ to A-). Fewer than 8 T-points may also increase your grade, depending on your number of T-points and where you lie on the curve. It is very easy to earn all 8 T-points, and most students choose to do so. This converts the exam median grade of B-/B into a final median grade of B or B+.   Take this class! You'll love it!

I highly recommend this class. Readings are interesting, and William Kelley is hilarious. If you pay attention during lectures and get a hold of the concepts in the text, you should be fine. Attending class is important, especially in the social psychology section. Tests are multiple-choice, and most of the questions are roughly the same as those in the study guide. Todd Heatherton is good too, but Ann Clark and Yale Cohen were uninspiring.
@
Todd Heatherton
/course/2477
This class was really not taught by just Prof. Kelley (he's the chair of the course). This term it was taught by Ann Clark, Yale Cohen, Kelley, and Todd Heatherton. They were all a little different.   Prof Clark was your typical lecturer. She wasn't boring but she wasn't interesting. Her slides were good, and she brought in some good outside studies.   Prof Cohen had the really meaty scientific stuff, and he was decent at explaining it... sometimes no one in the class had any idea what he was talking about, though.   Prof Kelley was cool. He brought in a lot of interesting stuff, and went really far to make the actual lectures interesting (and interactive). He was also really great about helping out with preparation for the midterm (he was the only one to give a study guide and a review session - no one else had either).   Prof Heatherton was really interesting, too. He used study statistics to make class both really interesting, and to relay information without being bland.   I found that the second half of the course was a lot more interesting and enjoyable. This was definitely due to Kelley and Heatherton over Clark and Cohen, but I think it also had to do with the actual course material.  Basically, for this course, you have to learn on your own from the book and from the lectures. The lectures will focus on parts of the book, but each prof will go into pretty good detail about various studies -- their areas of expertise. The first half of the class is more of the biological basis of psych, and the second half social psych. After each prof teaches for about 2 weeks, they give a 50 question multiple choice test (which is graded on a perfect standard deviation curve) and you won't see them again.

I originally took this course because I knew a few people who had taken it and I wanted an easy course.  It turned out to be maybe my hardest course of the term.  This class is known as a gut, but it is not.  The material is not too difficult, but there is too much of it.  This course attempts to cover all of psychology  during the course of one term, an impossible task.  The main problem with this course is that you are responsible for an incredible amount of information on the tests.  Some of the questions asked go into great detail, so you really need to memorize the book.  We cover pretty much the whole textbook, and each test is on about four chapters, which is too much information for one test.  The course has four sections, each with a different teacher and test, then a final.  There are also "t-point" experiments which can be done for extra credit.  However, these experiments, combined with the memorization required, make this course extremely time-consuming.  This said, the course material is extremely interesting.  Altogether, I would reccomend this course if you are a potential psych major or very interested in psychology, but not if you want a gut, because there is a very high workload.

The reading for this class, I thought, was pretty interesting.  The prof's just basically regurgitate whatever is in the text.  The way it was run when I took it, the tests were 75% from the book and 25% from lectures.  SO basically, you just had to read everything in the book.  not that bad actually...if you're interested in psych.  it's not that hard to get A/A-.
@
Kelly A.
/course/2477
The class was pretty much self-taught since the majority of the test questions came straight from the text.  It didn't seem like lectures were that important.  However, they were interesting to attend since the professors specialized in the field of psychology that they lectured on and seemed to get excited about the subject (like one professor lectured only on developmental psych, another only on cognitive psych, etc.).  The tests were all multiple choice, so that was a plus.  Also, there is ample opportunity for extra credit through simple labs.  Most of the time you just sit there and hit a button for half an hour.  Easy points.

The exams are multiple choice, which works for some and not others, but there's a lot of practice stuff out there-- mainly people's old exams and the book's website. Some professors are better than others, but most know their stuff.

Professor All of them were pretty engaging lecturers, although their multiple choice exams tended to include obscure references to minor details in the textbook, even to words that were merely italicized and not bolded.  Workload Work outside of class is purely reading the textbook and studying the textbook in time for each of the four exams plus the final.

The material is easy to learn, and Pulju's lectures nicely supplement the reading.   Homework was useful and easy, with a few scattered harder assignments here and there. Pulju also drops your lowest-graded homework assignment.  Exams were manageable, though the final was quite difficult. Pulju curves upwards from time to time.  Pulju himself is great he gives interesting and effective lectures, has a great deadpan style of humour and is ready to help you outside class.   I would highly recommend taking the class with Pulju.

I am still floored by this class. I read the reviews originally and I was convinced that I could take this to complete my QDS credit.  Well, I was completely wrong. I would have much rather suffered through Math 3 than take this course. I would only recommend this course for people interested in Linguistics--for those of you trying to get out of taking Math, just DON'T DO IT. Take a math course. Professor Pulju was decent, and he was available, but he makes his tests unnecessarily difficult, and it almost seemed like he was trying to make Ling 1 a weeder course. He is also not very understanding of students who are struggling--he expects everyone to understand a concept (that he usually didn't even teach) and for those who don't get it immediately, as he told me in a blitz, "Some people get it and some people don't".  The material is very difficult as well. It's very abstract (in my opinion) and a lot of concepts went clear over my head. I know that there's no such thing as an easy class at Dartmouth, but Linguistics 1 is extremely hard--way harder than I thought--so think twice when you sign up for this course.

This course was so much more than I ever expected it to be, even though I took it out of interest in the first place. If you have ANY interest whatsoever in ling, take this class, and take it with Prof Pulju. The guy's comments are hysterical and keep the lectures interesting - what other prof would actually say "absofuckinlutely" in front of a full lecture hall just to demonstrate a point? Just spend enough time on the homework assignments even though they can be a bit difficult. They're a really good indication of how well you understand the material and also probably how well you'll do on the exams. I'm definitely taking at least another class in the ling department because of this course!
@

/course/1956
There really isn't much of a middle ground. If you like logic and finding patterns and puzzles, you will love this class and you will love Pulju and you won't have to put in that much work or effort, even in studying for the big tests. The material either makes sense or it doesn't. If it does, there really isn't much to study since all analysis is based on the problem set at hand.  If, on the other hand, you don't like logic and puzzles, you will probably hate this class with a fiery passion. You'll work really really hard to understand concepts that just don't work with some people's brains. Don't take this class just to get out of taking a math class. You'll probably regret it.  If you're going to take Ling 1, take it with Pulju. He's hilarious and really knows his stuff.
@
Timothy Pulju
/course/1956
This class was very challenging. I took this class because I was always interested in Linguistics but I never knew exactly what the subject was about. How I regret that decision.  I must say that Professor Pulju is absolutely brilliant. He is quite knowledgeable about all aspects of linguistics and actually memorized every student's name and face (about 120) and which languages they speak, all within the first few weeks. Amazing. Also, he was always available for office hours which was very helpful.  However, this class is a LOT of work. We had problem sets, about 10-12 in total (he dropped the lowest two), and some of them were very challenging - some of the patterns were so intricate and took hours of banging your head against the wall to find. Thankfully, Pulju let us work with our classmates which definitely helped. However, sometimes it felt like he was "out to get us." I remember going over a homework problem in class when he said "I didn't expect most of you to find that [pattern], and I was right. I like being right about that stuff."  Our grade was composed of 25% participation/homework/in class quizzes, 25% Test 1, 25% Test 2, and 25% Final Exam. We covered Phonetics, Phonology, Morphology, Syntax, Semantics, and Historical Linguistics.  The tests are HARD. Be aware that he doesn't really curve. On the first test, he curved some tests but not others (I'd never heard of this before) and since I was above the median, my test wasn't curved at all. On the second test, he said he would probably curve the test but didn't end up curving it for anyone.  I should also warn you that the final was ridiculously hard. I walked out and felt stunned. Basically everyone took the full three hours. I ended up doing much better than I expected (I'm assuming he curved our final, at least a little bit) but that final was very, very difficult.  Overall, this class basically ate away at my term. It takes a lot of time to understand and grasp these concepts. Even though you think you understand a concept, you will see it on a test or quiz and realize you may not really know it. Another reviewer said that everyone complained about this class 24/7, and that was definitely true. I was told by several people that this class was abnormally hard for Ling 1. Part of the reason may be that Pulju opened the class out to about 120 students (it usually has about 70-80 students). He may have felt a bit overwhelmed (he had to wear a microphone every class) which may have accounted for its level of difficulty. But that's just a speculation.  I am actually very happy with my grade in this class - the amount of time I spent on this class luckily paid off. So, I'm not reviewing this class out of spite, but rather to let anyone reading this know what you are getting into. If you are going to take this class, I'd recommend taking it with a different professor, or at least maybe in a smaller class.  On one hand, I definitely have a solid knowledge of basic linguistics, but it was not worth the pain.
@

I took this class out of interest and found it engaging enough and overall enjoyed it.  I think that people who didn't like the class either weren't interested in the material, falsely expected it to be easy, didn't put enough work into the class, and/or are just not good at quantitative stuff.  The workload isn't too heavy, but it's definitely important that you keep up with the material.  A large component of the class was practicing the material and if you fall behind then it's easy to be lost in class.  The exams were a fair assessment of the material but they still make you think.  If you're interested in linguistics and want a class that will potentially challenge you then take this class with Pulju.

This is the only course guide review I have ever done because this is how much I HATED the class. I took it for a QDS thinking it would be fine and I would get an A and be done with it. WRONG.  It is BORING! Pulju doesn't teach he expects you to learn everything from the book. Most likely if you took it you would do fine, but you will never use this information again in you life...unless for some crazy reason you decide to major in it. The homework is long and pointless and the exams are brutal...if you miss a tiny detail he takes off full points.  I have never done worse or disliked a class more at Dartmouth.  Everyone I know in the class hates it....everyone is counting down the seconds until it is over. Seriously, everyone complains about it 24/7.  During an interview I was asked what my least enjoyable part of Dartmouth was...I said Linguistics. Enough said.  You have been warned. At least take it with another prof!!

Very great class! I would definitely recommend taking it, but if you are taking it for an easy A because you other classes are killer and you don't want to have to put much time into it (like me), then you should watch out.  It is very easy to lose lots of points in this class.  Staying on top of exams is crucial.  Try to avoid taking it in the fall (if you don't want to put much work in) because the class will be full of freshman trying to get their "straight A's" and making the class be curved downwards.  Just a tip.

This class was definitely not what I expected.  120+ plus of us had to cram into Carpenter for class each week.  Overall, your grade in the class reflected how much time you dedicated to your work, but there were some difficult concepts taught that the TA's couldn't really help the class with.
@
Timothy Pulju

This class was really interesting for me, but the work it entails is unlike the work for any other kind of class I have ever taken. The data analysis is unexpected and difficult, and if you are not good at finding patterns and reasoning, no amount of studying and understanding concepts can really help your grade.  It's a QDS for a reason, and Pulju made sure we understood that. That said, Pulju is really available and pretty engaging in class. Hes also really accommodating to your needs. This is an interesting class and I definitely recommend it if youre interested in language, but don't expect to ace it if youre not good at math.

Professor Pulju is an outstanding professor. Our class was especially large(140 or so) and he knew everyone's names, faces, and what languages they spoke. He engages you in class, asking questions to specific students, and classes mostly consist of doing practice problems which help you to understand.  The class and topic itself are also really interesting and different from anything I've ever done. The midterms are definitely a little hard, but he aims for a class median of 87 overall.

I took this course because I thought it would be the easiest way to get rid of my QDS distrib and I heard it was not going to be hard.  This ended up being the course that demanded the most of my time this term, with homeworks due 1-2 times a week that require a decent amount of time and effort and quizzes.  He also calls on random people every day, so you have to go to class if you want a good participation/attendance grade.  The exams were hard, but fair I guess.    Pulju reminds me of Dwight Shrute from the Office.  He has high expectations for an introductory class.

I took this course to fulfill my QDS distrib. Do NOT take Ling1 with Pulju if you are looking just to fulfill a distrib! It is much harder than it seems it'll be...trust me!   The homeworks are too hard and too few...some of us can't learn with one homework problem and then magically know it all! He doesn't give out any extra problem sets so that we can't even practice for the tests.  Pulju basically says, "If you know how to do this extremely hard problem set, you'll be fine on the test." Wrong. Even the Ling majors I've talked with say Pulju is tough and, to be honest, absurd with how much he expects students "to know". I'm positive there are other courses one can take to fulfill a distrib.

This class was the best class i've taken at dartmouth, but the reason for this is Pulju he makes the class really fun and interesting.  He's brilliant. You'll look forward to class, and you'll learn a lot too.  It's not terribly difficult either.  If you want a QDS but are afraid of math, go for ling 1 with pulju.

I've never received a grade below an A- in my life, outside of high school P.E.   Needless to say, I was less than satisfied with my grade, despite the work I put into the class, which was at least twice as much work as I spent on my two other courses combined.   The material can be easy, and also mind-numbingly difficult, and the class is far too quickly paced. My biggest problems with the class were these Pulju likes to write tricks into the tests, that are meant to make students lose points over idiotic snags in the problems. Furthermore, since he writes all the tests and homeworks, there is a serious disparity in the readings from the textbook and what is actually on the test, making it nearly impossible to master the material.   Basically, avoid this class if you care about your GPA and don't want to have an absurdly painful term, constantly worrying about your LING 1 grade. Take a Philosophy course instead.

This class was incredibly fun.  Prof. Pulju is hilarious and made lecture fun with his wackiness.  He is probably the reason why half of ling majors are ling majors.  The class itself was interesting and not difficult, and a good way to fill QDS if you need one.  An amazing class.
@
Timothy Pulju
/course/1956
Not a gut QDS, for sure. Definitely requires some thought.  Take it with Pulju. He's fabulous and hilarious in an unusual way. He inspired me to major in Ling, something I never even considered coming to Dartmouth. He has the class in stitches simply by saying "I kicked the hammer with my foot about the lawn" to illustrate syntax or by doing a Clark Kent/Superman impression to demonstrate phonetic similarity. I could totally see him as a Clark Kent/Superman. He's meek and geeky and awkward but extremely smart.  I had to work at this class. It's like math with words, and some things take a while to get. I didn't learn how to study for the tests until the final, which saved me in the end, but I really wish I would've learned earlier.  There are no numbers, but it is definitely a QDS. If you weren't good at or didn't like math in high school you won't like Ling at all. You need a mathematical mind to understand the abstract concepts it brings up. Take Psych 10 or Govy 10 or something if you have never been a math person.  I'm majoring because I like it a lot and because it's a challenge, not because it's easy. I'm really anal about grammar and spelling errors, so I have a good eye for it; it just takes a lot of effort to learn the rules.  But if you were good at math in high school and don't know what to major in, take it. You might just find you're a Ling person. But not everyone is, so be forewarned. It's demanding.

Ling I with Prof. Pulju was a great class. His sense of humor is dry and hilarious. Even though the class was fairly large, he made a good effort to know everyone's name in the class. The work load was not particulalry bad, and the exams were not overly difficult. It is a great way to get a QDS requirement and a great introduction to the Ling Department here.

Professor Pulju is a comprehensive, fair, engaging, and spastically funny professor who made this course worthwhile. In taking this course, I learned that I don't enjoy linguistics all that much, but I'm glad I took it nonetheless...parts of it were very interesting, and Pulju was great.  Homework/readings are never unbearable, quizzes are very fair, and the midterms/final are difficult but not impossible.

professor pulju has this fantastic, drawling humor.  Linguistics is pretty interesting too; not incredibly useful except to annoy your friends with when you analyze their speech according to the phonetic alphabet or something, but the course was very interesting.  There was about ten pages of reading a night with some questions.  Homework was only due sometimes but Pulju learns your names and calls on everyone.  I loved the class overall.

Pulju is one of the best profs I've had.    He was very good about explaining the material so that anyone could understand it, frequently using examples and anecdotes and calling on people.  He makes the large class very personal by learning everyone's name (and what languages they speak) and then using their collective knowledge when he's talking about specific languages.  He has an amazing sense of humor.  I don't think there was a single class session without at least a moderate dose of laughter.  Whether or not you end up liking linguistics, you'll have fun in this class; I know people who didn't do that well in the class, but loved it all the same.

I switched into linguistics a few days late knowing nothing about the class whatsoever.  It is definitely my favorite class I've taken so far at Dartmouth, though.  Pulju is the best professor.  He is very funny and engaging and interesting and quirky and I love the lectures, even if the subject matter being discussed is not the most interesting stuff.  The tests are a little hard and there is homework almost daily, but I enjoy this class and find it so interesting that I'm considering majoring in linguistics.  Definitely take this course!

It was an OK class. I took it to take a random class i na subject I had never learned before.  And, it was interesting.  Pulju is a good lecturer for teh first half o fthe class and seemed to trail off a little on th eless interesting material somewhere before the second mid-term - and we just started doing the homework exercises in class, which was a bummer.    But, overall, it was interesting and worth taking!

I personally found the material to be interesting and the work to be easy, but I also know people who disagreed on both points. However, I think everyone agrees that Prof. Pulju is a brilliant, devoted and HILARIOUS teacher. I recommend staying on top of the reading and going to TA sessions for an easy good grade. I also recommend that EVERY Dartmouth student takes a class with this guy before they graduate.

Prof Pulju gives great lectures and makes a potentially boring/frustrating subject incredibly interesting.

I took this course for a QDS distrib. Though I did not find the course especially interesting, Pulju's sense of humor made going over the rather dry material much more pleasant. The TA hours were very useful in getting help with the homework. It hasn't been my favorite class at Dartmouth, but it got the distrib out of the way relatively painlessly.

Pulju is one of those profs that can really handle a large class. He keeps your interest and manages to pass on the important stuff. He's also incredibly funny.  The class was very large this term, but it wasn't as noticeable because Pulju and the TAs got all assignments back quickly and efficiently. Things aren't that difficult, but it's no cakewalk either. Go to class.

Pulju is great--tries to learn everyone's name, even if there are 120 students in the class.  He gives entertaining, and sometimes even funny lectures, and the course is very fair.  There are graded homework assignments that are not usually hard but worth doing because they help you learn the material, they give a good idea of what will be tested, and count for a significant portion of your grade.  We had two or three quizzes that counted as much as a homework, two midterms and a final.  Linguistics is very interesting, and I feel like the course gave me a good overview of the field.  Definitely take Ling 1 with Pulju if you can though, I've heard Peterson is extremely boring.    Buy the book, you'll need to bring it to every class, but skip the workbook, you'll never use it.
@
Timothy Pulju
/course/1956
Even with a class of over 100 people, Pulju was responsive to students and thorough with his explanations/answers to questions.  Homework was relatively self-explanatory if you showed up to lectures and read the assigned chapters, and the tests were pretty much the same.  Pulju makes the most random yet somehow hilarious jokes, so even when the subject matter isn't horribly exciting, you'll still be entertained.
@

...you'd better believe it.  Pulju is simply awesome.  There is something a little bit weird about him, but once you get over that, he's one of the better profs out there.  He knows what he's talking about, and he's really fun and entertaining.  Definitely the prof to get for Ling or Classics classes.  Pulju is heavy on the daily workload though.  Linguistics 1 isn't such a big deal, but some of his other courses are gruelling.  Beware this prof if you want to sit back and relax.  He'll teach you well, if you're willing to step up to the challenge.

Linguistics 1 with Pulju is a great class. Spring term it was huge, close to 120 people, but Pulju had a gift for making it seem smaller. At the beginning of the term, we had to write down information about ourselves on note cards (name, where from, languages we know, etc.) and throughout the term he would call on us in class to answer questions about homework and exercises. Knowing that you may be called on at any moment is really a good motivation to pay attention. Besides that, Pulju is a fascinating teacher. He's kind of quiet & withdrawn in person, but also has this wry sense of humor and says the most bizarre things at random in the middle of class sometimes. And he's extremely responsive to questions in & out of class... he appreciates people taking the material seriously & showing curiosity. The material can be tough. It requires keeping up with the reading & being very logical & persistent (& careful with detail) while solving the problems. I thought it was fascinating, but then I love languages...  Linguistics 1 is really a zoom through all different areas of linguistics, starting with morphology (breaking a word up into its meaningful parts) and sweeping through all the most important areas of language, ending with historical (although that might change different years.) Pulju's weakest area is definitely syntax. He has philosophical differences with the theory he's required to teach for this unit & therefore doesn't teach it very well. There were occasional times where he really didn't give us accurate explanation on this unit, & I didn't feel that his taking things off on homework was fair. But overall, great course. It's very cool to be able to apply logical quasi-scientific analysis to language and figure out how it works.

If you're considering taking this class because you just want to get rid of that pesky QDS requirement, go for it, this was a very engaging and entertaining class.  On the other hand, if you're considering this class because you think linguistics is an interesting field, again, definitely take this, Prof. Pulju is incredible.  Even if you aren't doing well in the class or can't quite get into the material, his teaching style makes the whole class a very enjoyable experience.

I randomly took this course and it turned out to be really great, mostly becuase Pulju is an amazing guy. He explains the material far better than the book does, but most importantly he is very funny and interesting in lecture. He actually knew everyone's name (in a 70 person lecture) within about 2 weeks and trys really hard to get class participation. The course itself was interesting to me, and not too hard, though there were a couple problem sets that were tricky.

Classes are so enjoyable because he's so deadpan funny; you never know whether he's trying to be funny or not.  And at the same time he teaches you the material so well you barely need the book.  Though it's a huge class, he's always calling on people and answering questions, so it's not really a lecture class.  I had no idea what linguistics even was and he gave a fabulous introduction.  Great for anyone just curious about the subject.

This course goes over various fun ways of analyzing patterns within language. Mathematicians will very much enjoy the course and are very much advised to take it despite not needing a QDS credit.

It's worth it, really. Professor Pulju's witticisms are not to be missed. Also, just reading the book alone will get you only about 80% of the answers.

Class was interesting, and Prof. Pulju was not only interesting and informative, but also hilarious (check out the facebook.com group devoted to him). My friend and I would actually look forward to doing homework and studying. If you think grammar is cool, or you read the dictionary for fun, this course is for you . . . or if you just want a way to satisfy your QDS distrib that will easily get you an A or B, and definitely at least a C (can't say so much for Math--it's easy to get an E in Math). Before I took this class, I thought learning something about Linguistics might be kind of interesting, but now I am almost entirely certain that I will major in the subject. Anyway--great class, great prof. (I'm even taking another course that he's teaching next term).

If you're trying to fill a QDS requirement and Math 3 doesn't look all that exciting, take this course.  Professor Pulju presents what could be relatively boring course material in a direct and entertaining way.  In general, I feel like this is one course where my general knowledge was increased; I found that what I learned in this class easily applied to my other studies (like the study of the Swahili language in Pre-Colonial African History) and will contribute to my later studies of foreign language.

If the thought of taking a math class terrifies you, this is probably the class for you... but beware  just because there's no numbers involved with this class doesn't mean you won't have to work.

All the same, I really enjoyed this class and would encourage anyone to take it.

This course was really awesome. You learn so much about languages, and it isn't tons of work. Professor Pulju is an amazing professor. He really knows what he's talking about (he loves pointing out errors in our textbook). His lectures are informative and even entertaining. His humor makes the course even more enjoyable. There isn't much reading, and for homework, you apply the concepts you learned in class into analyzing linguistics data from different languages. You will encounter so many languages you never even heard of. The tests are fair too. I will definitely take other linguistics courses in Dartmouth. Take this course!

Pulju does his best to make everyone love linguistics as much as he does. Once you get used to his style, there is something about the man makes him hilarious and engaging.

/course/1956
When I first entered class and listened to Professor Pulju drone on in a monotone voice about the history of linguistics, I prepared myself for a long term. But Linguistics turned out to be a great class, due to Professor Pulju himself. He had well-prepared lectures and went over the subjects in perfect detail so that all 80+ students in the class understood. The well-informed TAs supplemented his lectures with frequent review sessions and office hours each week. Pulju's dry wit was very entertaining, but he also knows his stuff and can gauge the class' interest and understanding as well.  As an English major, this class made me feel like I could solve mathematical problems on my own, without feeling hopelessly lost like in other QDS courses. Tests and homework assignments were challenging, but an A is more than possible if you put the effort into it.

Awesome prof...Pulju is such a funny guy, he makes syntax and semantics actually fun.  The only warning is that he like to surprise you on the exams with material that he hasn't gone over, so sometimes studying doesn't even do much good.  But overall, this is such a fun class-

Ling 1 is the easiest way to get a QDS credit.  Pulju is a funny guy and injects some humor into the material; however, the course is still extremely boring.

Yes, i took ling 1 for my QDS credit. i wanted to get that ugly distributive out of the way immediately, so decided i'd take linguistics. mind you, i had no prior exposure to the subject. in any event, it was a very pleasant surprise. the workload is perfectly reasonable... you basically just read from your one textbook. it isn't the most interesting thing, but eh... so it goes.  to be honest, the subject itself isn't all that fascinating, but pulju makes the class pretty darn fun(ny). the man is HILARIOUS. i'd like to think of him as a brilliant version of Milton (from Office Space).  Just notice the way he holds his palm up when referring to things on the blackboard. it's great. so his tests... they are a LOT harder than the homeworks. but despite any qualms i have about the difficulty of the tests -- and indeed, they are the most difficult part of the course, since the quizzes/homeworks are relatively simple -- i would definitely recommend this course to anyone who needs to fulfill the QDS. go for it.

I signed up for this class not knowing what to expect, but hoping it would be interesting.  Boy, was it ever!  This ranks in the top couple of classes I've ever had.  The class was fascinating.  It was not overly pedantic, and students got to actually apply readings to data sets for homework.  But the real reason this was such a great course is the professor Tim Pulju.  Pulju has a great zest for his subject; he was not one of those professors who teach because they have to.  The most fun was our unit on historical linguistics (that's his specialty), but everything else was also fun.  Pulju is one of the funniest people I've ever met; his sense of humor is truly inspired, and this makes the lectures far more engaging and interesting than they otherwise could be.  I give this course an enthusiastic thumbs-up.

Puliju is far and away the funniest professor you will ever have at Dartmouth. Somewhere in between the Michael Jackson jokes and references to bear sex, however, Puliju manages also to deliver excellent, engaging lectures that almost made me want to add a linguistics minor in my Junior year. Oh yeah, and he learned every single student's name in the class and could identify all of us on sight, which is how he called on us in class. There were over 100 students in the class. This is a guy you want to get to know. Did I mention its a QDS? And there's no math? Yeah, you should take this class.

If nothing else it's an easy QDS

While Ling 1 was a very interesting class taught by a hilarious and helpful teacher, be forewarned that this is not as easy as made out to be.  I took Ling 1 because I was hoping to get a easy QDS and like most classes with that reputation, it was harder than expected.  Combined with a mentality that it would be very easy, the classes reputation is a good deal exaggerated and ended up causing me a little trouble when it came down to the finality of the grade I was getting.  Nonetheless, if someone put in more effort and time then myself, I'm sure they would do fine.  And the professor is alot of fun and the material fairly engaging.

Although there were a gazillion people in class, Prof. Pulju managed to keep everyone's attention.  He was nothing short of hilarious.  He said all these funny things that were both relevant and irrelevant to class, but that didn't matter because everyone paid attention either way.  The people that took this class just to get a QDS were not disappointed.  Even if you don't need a QDS (I didn't) then take this class anyway & take it with Prof. Pulju, it's worth it.

The class was really interesting most of the time because pulju is very entertaining.  The material was not difficult and we had almost no homework, which was nice.  test problems were often challenging, but they were fairly graded and usually do-able.  Overall, a nice way to get my QDS, and I might even take more ling classes just for the hell of it.

My criticism of Ling1 can be summed up in one statement insufficient preparation for exams. The homework assignments given in the class were so easy as to be almost trivial, while exams demanded mastery of concepts barely introduced in the homework assingments. While Professor Pulju was very helpful outside of class (and an effective lecturer, although his lectures suffered from the same incompleteness as his homework assignments and quizzes), it was not until the very end of class that he introduced more difficult practice material, which aided immensely in my preparation for the final. In sum, while I still did well in his course, I would have liked to have seen more difficult homework and practice throughout, as I did not feel that I mastered the material until just before the final exam.    In spite of these difficulties, Professor Pulju informed us that there will be a supplementary practice manual in this fall's installment of the course, which should make for an excellent introduction to the matertial given that he himself is a most competent, and entertaining lecturer.

If you hate math, take linguistics 1! its definately not as hard and so much more interesting. this is the first time i can say i actually feel educated after taking a class.  the material is fascinating and you get a whole new look on languages of the world. the material gets a little challenging, but still not that bad and homework is maybe twice a week with weekly quizzes. not to mention prof. pulju is histerical in that (weird kinda way). i have no desire to be a ling major/minor, but i'm glad i took this class.
@

/course/1956
I've heard that the class can have a tough work load if taken with other profs.  With Pulju, very little outside work is required, and A's are easy to come by.  But don't let that deter you.  Pulju is a brilliant man, a funny and entertaining prof, and is generally a friendly guy.  He's very accessible via blitz; I never felt like I had to chase him down in his office, although I'm sure he would be available there as well.  I found the material interesting, but I can see how some would find it dry.  The grades are inflated, the prof is great, and there's very little out-of-class work.  There's really no reason why you *shouldn't* take this class.

Professor Pulju is one of the funniest men at Dartmouth. We gave him a standing ovation on the final day of class, even though a lot of us were dissatisfied with our grades. He calls on people randomly during class, so show up!  The textbook was comprehensive, and learning linguistics was enjoyable. But the tests were difficult, and Pulju graded them almost all-or-nothing. I didn't take an analysis far enough, and he gave took off 30 points, even though the work I had done was correct.

The class is a lot of fun with prof pulju. he makes it interesting even if you don't have a great love for linguistics. he is fun and receptive, as well as being good at explaining and teaching. the class is a great way to get QDS credit if you don't like math and on the whole one of my favorite classes here so far.

/course/1956
Pulju is a really good professor.  He makes funny jokes throughout his lecture, often getting the entire class to crack up in laughter.  Besides being entertaining, he is VERY accessible both through blitz and office hours.  To ensure that his class has enough time to complete the exams, he hands out the test data beforehand for us to analyze.  His tests are fair and although there are quizzes and graded assignments, two of the lowest grades are dropped in the end.  Anybody who takes this course should do so with Timothy Pulju.

@

/course/1956
An easy way to get your QDS. If you have an analytical bone in your body you should be able to glide through. Pulju was pretty good -- a funny guy -- but he's only a visiting prof so he probably won't be back anyway. The content should remain the same, though, and it is not much of a strain.

I hadn't had any idea that there were so many fascinating branches of linguistics, and Prof. Pulju introduced us to all of them, through fascinating, clear, and precise lectures and the odd dry-humored joke.  It was much harder than I expected of an intro-level course, but definitely worth it.  Be prepared to do a lot of thinking outside of class!  Pulju is a great prof; he makes the material come alive.

I met Prof. Grenoble during orientation week and thought she would be fun to take a class with and I also considered majoring in linguistics.  Well, she is a great professor but she's also dean of faculty (I think) so she didn't always respond quickly to blitzes and sometimes had to cancel office hours.  However, she really loves teaching which is very evident in her lectures and the way she responds to students.   Dave (Prof. Peterson)has very good intentions but can get a little boring.  He's long-winded on uninteresting topics and speaks in a monotone.  He is quite helpful outside of class, though, and extremely friendly. My main problem with the class is that we spent weeks on less interesting topics and about 15 minutes on more interesting topics, which is why I was disappointed...

Hands down, Ling 1 is the best class I have taken at Dartmouth. The material is fascinating, the professors were great, and the workload was very reasonable. After taking this class as a fall-term Senior, I decided to modify my major with Linguistics. That's how good this class is. Take it!
@

Take this class if you have a real interest in the subject or want an easy course.  Although interesting, it just wasn't for me.  Petersen's lectures are rambly, but Grenoble's are quite good.
@

/course/1956
This class was a good overall introduction into the areas of Linguistics. I felt that we covered a good amount of basic material. However, the team teaching left a little to be desired, but most of was on the tests was in the book. This is a good class to take if you're looking for a lighter load to balance out writing intensive classes.
@
Lenore A.
/course/1956
Some people hate this course, and others love it.  I would suggest it just to try it out.  You never know if you might find a love for the subject or maybe a very inspirational prof such as Lenore Grenoble.  If you have an opportunity to take a class with her, do it.  She is always upbeat and ready to teach.  It's obvious she loves what she's doing, and tries to bring out that passion in her students.  However, if the Linguistics course is taught solely by Dave Peterson, avoid it like the plague.  He is extremely boring and monotone.  He assumes the students already know the material, and also has a tendency to be moody.
@
Lenore A.
/course/1956
I thought linguistics would be an interesting class to take, but it just went downhill after the first few classes.   The professors aren't too great, and the material is kind of difficult to learn by yourself. Either stay on top of the work, or you'll be pretty miserable.

Although parts of this course were interesting, I found that the majority was not.  Prof Peterson talks mostly in a monotone, and very softly (he did finally start to use a microphone about halfway through the term).  Professor Grenoble is really enthusiastic and energetic, though, so she helped to liven things up.  The tests and homework were very fair; all you really have to know are the processes for how to do certain things. This means that you don't really have to do much work between the midterms, except a couple of homework assignments that are handed in.  Even though I like studying foreign languages, linguistics was just a little too tedious for me, and very unlike foreign language study...hence my lack of enthusiasm.

I really enjoyed the topic.  There were only 4 formal homework assignments and some informal ones that were collected.  Overall, the tests were kind of hard.

The class is good to take to get a better undestanding of language, it's fun and not so much work; if you study, shouldn't be too tough. It's team taught and sometimes the professors would disagree on a few things, made for some fun times and laughs in class, so not bad. Prof Peterson does go a little fast, but "You already know this, It's all in your book," is what they'd say when we asked them to slow down the slides, yeah most of it is powerpoint and they don't use blackboard, so take notes, and read the book, it's enjoyable, at least I thought so, didn't inspire me to make Linguistics my major, but I might take another class in it somewhere along the line if I need a schedule filler and nothing else catches my eye first; interesting stuff sometimes, sometimes it's dull, but in general, it's chills.
@
Lenore A.
/course/1956
actually, lenore and dave were alright, pretty dynamic together, always joking and stuff, but quite frankly, the course went a little too fast and i never felt like we covered things adequately before we moved on. the homeworks were spaced so far apart that there was no need to do anyhthing in between them, meaning everyone i know learned the material right before the midterm. plus, linguistics is one of those courses that you either like or dislike, and if you dislike it, it seems to me that its a lot harder to get a good grade. the final was pretty fair, basically a fusion of all the midterms, homeworks were alright although hard because we'd learn the stuff right before we did it and of course, that was a bit inadequate. but basically, i did very little work but im sure if id done a little more (than like 1 hr a week) i would have done better. not too hard, but not exactly that interesting.

Well, I actually enjoyed the class a lot, simply because the material was interesting, the exams were fair and not hard to handle with, and the homework became helpful review material and interesting exercise after the help of TA sessions.  Professor Grenoble was a great lecturer/teacher/prof in general.  Her lectures were much more intriguing comparing with David's - she has lots of jokes to sell too.  Yet David was extremely helpful conducting extra review sessions towards the end of the term. The TAs were the best. They helped a LOT with our homeworks.   At first I thought I would be "dinged" (the first interesting word/phenomenon we talked about at class) by this class, but later it became fun.  Perhaps at the beginning the class seem "hard", but after a period of time you will realize the beauty of linguistics - analyzing different sets of language data and  coming up with hypothesis is the most fun part. People hated drawing syntactic trees and historic linguistics - yet if you work on it and go to TA or review sessions, you will be just fine.  I was not a linguistics person from the start but after this great intro class I liked it.  I think it'd be much harder with other professors in the Linguistics department.  So for a great intro and interesting combination of professors, this is a good class to take.

The Grenoble-Peterson combo. was great, and I will definitely look for more classes either taught by the two, or definitely by Grenoble in the future. Though Peterson wasn't the most interesint prof. I've had, he was extremely knowledgable in the material and always willing to help. Grenoble also knew her stuff and was great to talk to outside the class, and she and Peterson balanced each other out PERFECTLY. The lectures were pretty interesting, and though the book was sometimes no good, the profs. clarified all. Great way to fill your QDS.
@
Lenore A.
/course/1956
If you need a QDS and are allergic to math, take this course.  Some of the material is really interesting, but they tend not to test on it.  Very little of the material is deathly boring though.  The textbook sucks, but you don't have to read most of it all that carefully.  The dynamic between Grenoble and Peterson makes this class more interesting, but sometimes they aren't aware of what the other one has told the class, which can confuse you.

This class was a great introduction to linguistics and I will definitely take more courses in this department in the future. Very interesting subject matter. Prof. Grenoble gave great lectures - very animated and interesting. The only problem was that she sometimes had to cancel her office hours, but the ones I did attend were very helpful. Prof. Peterson's lectures were less effective than Grenoble's and he had a tendency to speak too softly or in a monotonous voice. Despite this, he was very accessible and helpful. The tests were very fair and not terribly difficult. As long as I reviewed the homework I did fine. Overall, a great class and one I would definitely recommend.
@

To begin with Dave Peterson is a horrible lecturer.  Do not take a lecture class with this man.  I could not keep awake for the life of me while he was talking.  Secondly, linguistics might be interesting, but this course was clearly designed for English majors who are just trying to get their QDS out of the way, and is therefore paced to the level of about a middle schooler.  Honestly, it was not necessary for me to read the book, stay awake during lecture, or spend more than an hour on each of 4 "problem sets."  Basically after memorizing one chart in the book, and learning the two linguistic techniques that could possibly pass as QDS, you are good to go for the entire class, including the exams.  The only reason I can think of to take this class is if your other two classes are very difficult and time intensive and you need a slightly stimulating gut for your third class.

I transferred into this class about 2 weeks in and it was really easy to catch up. The team teaching style is helpful because Grenoble is energetic and fun and Peterson is a little boring but their interaction was often amusing. I found the material interesting although it wasn't necessary to read all the assignments.  There were 4 graded homeworks, 2 midterms, and a final, all of which were easy. You should take it to fulfill the QDS, especially if you are interested in languages, because it's interesting and not a lot of work.

/course/1956
I definitely enjoyed the team teaching, but the class was never really consistant.  Sometimes the professors played off of each other quite well and I found myself able to easily grasp the content of the lectures, other times the class seemed more like a comedy show with no real substance, and sometimes it just degraded into a confusing argument.  I actually felt like I studied too much for this class.  I did the readings and took notes during all the lectures -- but this wasn't truly necessary.  The tests covered quite broad concepts/skills and only focused on a few of the many areas we addressed.  I found the content intriguing, so I enjoyed the class.  However, I know many people who found the class frustrated, difficult, and boring.  Moral of the story if you think words are cool, come to the first few class periods and see if you like the dynamic...  if you fine yourself unsure, don't take the class.
@
Lenore A.
/course/1956
This class was pretty terrible- probably to be expected, since it was an intro course and 90% of the people in it (myself included) only wanted the QDS.  You do get your QDS without doing math, but the lectures (especially Peterson's) are really boring, and the homework and tests are pointless memorization that you forget the minute you turn them in.  Occasionally you get hints of the fact that linguistics could be really cool, but that isn't really showcased in the class.  The class discussion is pretty poor as well, unless you like hearing that peoples' friends from California say "hella", while their friends from Massachusetts say "wicked".  There must be a better way to get your QDS, but if you can't find one, take this class with a few friends and bring the crossword puzzle.
@
Lenore A.
/course/1956
First, I never wanted to take this course, but did so anyway for the QDS.  Not a single number or variable was used in the class.  This course SHOULD NOT BE A QDS.  I take BIO classes that involve A TON of math, but get no QDS for them, and then am forced to take this class to get the distrib even though math is not involved.  It's clear the LING department has put a QDS on the course to increase enrollment in their class, and I think that's a perversion of the system.  Dartmouth needs to clean up its distribs.  On to the actual course... The Professors were pretty good, but the students in the class were obnoxious.  Ridiculous questions, unnecessary lingering on subjects, freaking out when the Profs would change a power-point slide on which the information was not anything groundbreaking. Even the profs found this annoying.  These kids are so motivated they don't know how to A. remember anything, or B. know when something is irrelevant or can be found in the book which they paid for, but like myself, obviously don't read. If you take a giant lecture course like this, chill out a little.  The material was somewhat interesting.  The homeworks and tests were the best part of the course.  The problems are fun to solve. Quantitative reasoning is involved, but really not much...  The teachers weren't bad... the lectures were painful.

This was a fun class and I really learned a lot.  It takes care of your QDS without taking Calculus (thank you God) and is pretty cool.  However, don't plan to actually digest the material - it goes really fast and it's hard to keep up with it if you're trying to really learn it more than just to get through the tests.

Some of the material we covered was ... inane.  Lenore and Dave cant teach... esp. together. They'd get some difficult questions and answer "don't worry about it, you don't need to know that", when in fact we did need to know it for a test or assignment!  Their notes were poorly written and confusing... often the information in the notes one day would conflict with the notes of the next day.  If you take this course, ignore the profs n read the book!
@

/course/1956
this course is interesting for me to think about....i enjoyed what we actually learned but did not enjoy the manner in which the profs presented the material, nor how the material was tested (unlike the teaching and readings)....you should still take the class....be warned...readings are not as important as you may think...entire units...like sociolinguistics and animal language...are not tested...you need to be able to SOLVE PROBLEMS for the tests...they are not multiple choice....they are not as hard as you think they are going to be....you should go to class, only because they did not put the slides on blackboard...also try not to get a class with Peterson....Grenoble is much better
@

/course/1956
This class is an awesome introduction to linguistics.  Although it is quite easy, with very little homework, the problem sets are a great way to practice applicable, deductive reasoning (and a perfect substitute for math, if that's not your thing.)  Prof. Grenoble is AMAZING.  She gives great lectures, and is funny and engaged.  Take a class with Prof. Grenoble.  Prof. Paterson gives long, boring lecture straight from the powerpoint slides.  HOWEVER, his teaching is mitigated by Grenobles, and they actually make a great team.  Also, Paterson does try hard to give good lectures and have a sense of humor, and even by the end of the term his presentational skills had improved.

Pretty easy, but the prof made the class so boring.  i think it could have been really interesting if i would have had a different prof, but it honestly didn't really matter if you went to class because she put handouts online that she gave you in class that were taken directly from the book.  I would recommend it if you're looking for a good class to supplement two harder classes.

Yes, this class could have been pretty easy... but if you don't pay attention in class, don't do any of the readings, rush through the assignments, etc...you'll can get a bad grade.  Do the minimum and I'm assuming you'll have an easy time.  She tells you pretty much exactly what's on the final, its awesome.

/course/1956
I took this class on a whim, and I'm now seriously considering a ling major. Both Professor Chitoran and the textbook made the material very interesting and relatively easy. There are only 5 homework assignments and they're not hard to complete, but the grading can be tough, as small errors can cost you. The midterm and final were incredibly easy if you studied for them. Professor Chitoran is very kind and always willing to help you. I strongly recommend this class.

I love linguistics and studying languages, so I thought this class was great.  However, I was a little frustrated with the pace.  She did a great job incorporating students into the discussion and encouraged people to ask questions.  However, because of this increased participation, the pace of the course was slowed down a lot in order to accommodate slower learners.  It's great that no body was left behind and confused, but frustrating for those who wanted to cover more material.

I took this class for QDS, and it was very easy, interesting, and covers topics (e.g. phonetics) that it is helpful to know.  Definitely take it!  Chitoran is very sweet and gets excited over the subject.  No need to do readings because she teaches everything.

/course/1956
Ling 1 should be a good class, and I hear that it can be taught very well and be a lot of fun with the right professor. Unfortunately, Professor Chitoran is a nice person but not the best lecturer. I found the lectures to be boring and/or confusing, compared to the other linguistics courses I have taken with other professors. It is an easy course, though, with a couple problem sets, a take-home midterm, and in-class final. I would definitely recommend this class if taught by Professors Pulju or Ernst, as they are amazing.
@
Ioana Chitoran
/course/1956
The course is a survey, so there are some parts (morphology, syntax) that are much more interesting than others (phonology and phonemics). Chitoran had trouble managing the class, at first being way to lenient and then flipping out later when people weren't paying attention. The assignments aren't long, but they're often given after just a passing introduction to the material so you have no idea if you're going to do well on them. 5 take home assignments, 1 take home midterm, 1 memorization quiz on the phonetic alphabet, and 1 in class final (which was bull because we didn't have to do anything in class before that). I feel like the subject could be better with a more competent prof, still it's not brutally hard, occasionally really interesting, and knocks off a qds.
@

/course/1956
This course is truly meant as an introduction to linguistics, which could be a little frustrating if you wanted to delve a little more into certain topics.  Other than that, everything was great, the work load was pretty light, and Professor Chitoran was kind of quirky but definitely wanted to get people interested in linguistics.

This course was really not that exciting and no one in the class really took it seriously. I feel most people did it for the QDS distrib...  I thought the class had the potential to be interesting, but the professor just did not make the material interesting...  I think she means well and is very nice and helpful, but in the end I didn't get anything of substance out of the class-  Work is easy and the final exam is really easy. Doesn't take up much time and you don't need to do the readings or pay attention to lectures. She hands out class notes that you can glance back at later.

so it's not that bad. i barely did the reading but i did go to almost every class. most people would just be blitzing on their computers during class because they weren't interested in the topic. after this, she instated a "NO LAPTOP" rule. not too many people spoke up unless called on, just a guy and a girl in the first couple rows. professor is a darling and is a good topic of conversation outside of class. she's happy to meet whenever and will help you with every assignment. she even memorized every kid's name that was share every so often. i felt like an individual in a lecture of 80!! i loved ling after this.   be very meticulous on your assignments because the TAs will grade you as such. read the blitzes the TAs send out...i found them (the blitzes) to be really helpful. there is one quiz for 10% and i remember a lot of people getting Cs, Ds, or Fs. STUDY and you will get an A. don't slack off because that quiz cost a lot of people A/A-s.   good qds if you despise math.

I'm a ling major, so I had to take Ling 1 as a prereq. Unfortunately, Pulju was no longer teaching the course, and that would have been so much better. Instead, we got Chitoran. While she means well and is a skilled linguist, she is a horribly boring lecturer. Most of the class was just people looking for a QDS, but I feel like she turned off most of those people to linguistics, if they had any sort of linguistic inkling whatsoever. Class was insanely easy, because we worked at a snail's pace. It's also a survey course, so you learn a lot of the very basics about all the different disciplines, so there really are no hard concepts.  Overall, good course, and I think people should be exposed to the material, but avoid this prof.

Perhaps others are better, I wouldn't know.

Overall this class is pretty easy.  Very little is expected of you, and you can DEFINITELY get by without ever stepping foot into the classroom (except for maybe the final).  Some of the stuff is kind of tricky, but its al very interesting.

Not to say everyone will have an epiphany, but the class is REALLY laid back. Prof. Chitoran is really nice and basically gives u everything you need to know, and I mean EVERYTHING. You don't have to go to class but I do recommend it since some things could get a little tricky and very analytical. One quiz (10%), 5 HW assignments, a midterm and a final. She's enthusiastic about the topics and very willing to help. 2 TAs were there but I personally never used them. Overall a pretty good class to take, especially in the spring when you need a class to skip to enjoy the weather!

once you take linguistics you realize what an utter waste of time the entire subject is.  this is not a subject applicable to any other and is not all that fun to begin with.  Unless you are a fanatic i highly suggest not taking this class, sure you may be able to get some time to catch up with friends or sleep during it but really, their not that comfy of chairs.

be prepared for a large class, many of whom are there to fulfill the quantitative distrib.  you may be surprised how interestign some of the material seems, especially if you're into languages. but overall, it doesnt really hold you at the edge of your seat. its ok to miss a lecture or fall behind on the reading, the take-hoem assignments make sure you've understood the gist.  Prof chitoran understood some people there found it realyl boring and tried to wake peopel up every now and again with soemthign interesting. she used a lot of her lecture tiem to do practice problem sets.

GO TO CLASS!  I skipped class often because it was so ridiculous and boring, and it came back to haunt me.    I thought the subject material was stupid.  A senior ling major told me that what Chitoran was teaching us was what they were just learning in phonology class, etc, and not like normal intro stuff.  Chitoran means well, but she's just not a good professor.  Apparently, the other ling 1 professor is much better and the material more interesting.  This course makes linguistics seem like math with letters and sounds.  it's really weird.

Prof Chitoran is a very caring and very fair professor. This course was not terribly challenging at all, and if you want proof look up the median grade. She clearly likes her stuff, but the lectures could be a bit boring at times. Either way, she was organized, the assignments, midterm, and final were fair and very straight forward. I never did any of the required reading, I just used the charts in the book. It's a great class for a major, a QDS, whatever you want.

I took this course without any clue what linguistics was, but it seemed like it would be interesting.  The first lectures were interesting, but it soon seemed that we were spending much too long on the same subjects (phonetics and morphology) and barely touching some others which I thought would probably be more intersting (Historical Linguistics).  The problem sets were easy to do, but took quite a while to finish, and often involved looking up a lot in the book. A lot of people in the class thought they were easy, but didn't spend as much time as they should of on them, and ended up not doing so well.   Professor Chitoran's lectures were alright, but she did have a tendency to ramble on, or even get caught up in an extended argument with a student about a topic.   The course was a decent intro to linguistics, but I felt that we ended up with an uneven understanding of the subject, going much more indepth in some topics than others.

This class was fairly interesting, but don't take it with Ernst. I had no idea about this going in, but apparently, he's known to be one of the worst profs in the department. I will say that he is very friendly and has very organized outlines that make notetaking in class and organizing the material extremely straightforward. However, he makes the class unnecessarily hard. While the day-to-day work in this class is minimal, you have to study a ton for the exams to do well, and even then, that's not guaranteed. My friend who took this class last term with a different prof had much easier assessments so I would recommend taking this class with someone else.
@

Ling 1 is interesting and cool material, but Ernst is terrible. He's super condescending and makes the class insanely hard. He does not care about students, he only cares about making himself look as smart as possible. Very hard to do well on tests even if you thoroughly understand the material because Ernst only looks for very specific answers.
@
Thomas Ernst
/course/1956
Having read the reviews of other Ling 1 classes, I can say that there were no surprises here.  Professor Ernst is a very engaging professor and he makes the lecture hall feel a lot smaller than it really is with 90 or so students spread out.  He makes a great effort to learn everyone's name and loves to have people in the class with diverse language experience offer up answers to questions based on their knowledge.  The lectures are interesting to listen to and never does it feel as though he is simply talking to a sea of blank faces.  The homework is not difficult, and frankly most of the reading is easy to avoid until you scan through chapters for answers or methods to do things.  Be wary of only reading or only paying attention in class however, as the professor often assumes things only in the reading and often adds things you can't find in the book.  Overall a very good introductory course that I would recommend to people with vested interest in Linguistics, and for casual people looking to fulfill their distrib.

Prof Ernst did a great job with this class. Clear lectures and expectations. There were no surprises as far as the exams went, and that made the class a lot easier because you knew he wanted you to learn the material and not trip you up. If you came to class and did the reading you should have done well.  The subject was very interesting, and I feel like I learned a lot. The HW could be annoying, but it forced you to stay on top of the work which was good.  Overall, this was a great way to get a QDS and I would seek out another class with this prof.

An intro class that is pretty fun and interesting.  There are definetly things learned in class that are not important unless you are planning on continuing in higher levels, but for a QDS for non-mathy people, it's excellent.  Ernst is a fun guy who is always enthusiastic about his lectures and has meticulous transparencies that are easy to follow along with.

Ling 1 with Ernst is a pretty good class...it's very easy/laid back...Ernst is a pretty good lecturer (even if he makes his share of mistakes), and his sense of humor makes class more engaging/less boring.

I have to say the grading was a tad ridiculous (in a bad way) on some of the assignments, and some times what the professor would say in class would not agree with the text.  Other than that, the course was fine.

/course/1956
I initially signed up for this class because it seemed like the least painful way to get a QDS, and ended up wanting to major in Ling.  Professor Ernst was great, and presented the material in a way that was interesting and easy to follow.  Some topics were a bit boring, but we covered so much that we always moved on to something really interesting within a few days.  I appreciated his effort to learn everyone's name and call on different people, and the fact that homework and tests were always graded and returned by the next class meeting.  The homework took a bit of time, but wasn't too difficult if you'd done the reading and could discuss the problems with classmates.  The grading was very picky (points off if you use the wrong kind of arrow, etc...) but seemed fair.  There were review sessions held after each midterm, where he went over the entire exam and considered questions about any grading issues or concerns.  Overall, a great class.  You definitely have to do the work and pay attention during lectures, but you'll learn a ton in the process.

Don't take this class just because it's  an easy to get out of taking math for your distribs.  You actually need to have an interest in the stuff to like it/do well in this class.  That said, though, it's a great way to start if you're interested in ling. Ernst is a good lecturer and makes it very clear what's important to know for tests etc.  The class can get a little dry sometimes, especially because there's so much material to cover and because it's a huge lecture class, but Ernst really tries to make the subject interesting and tells funny, linguistics related (sort of) stories occasionally.    Overall, a good intro class and well worth taking if you're interested in the subject.
@

I was worried about this class because I only took it out of interest and really have no background in linguistics.  I was pleasantly surprised by how well I took to it and how much I liked it.  Ernst's lectures were fairly entertaining and surprisingly engaging for such a large class.  His lectures were clear, well-organized, and interesting, even when the topic was a little dry.  I highly recommend this class to anyone for any reason!
@

Coming into college, they tell you that intro classes will be large and impersonal with lots of reading...this one wasn't, though!  Professor Ernst is very energetic and quirky, he really brings the material to life.  He also shortens and adjusts the readings on the syllabus (rarely, but still), so it's important to go to class...honestly though, if you either go to class or do all the readings you'll get an easy A, no problem.  even better, do both.  neither one is that long or difficult.

Professor Ernst is pretty much amazing. He is relaxed, funny, and good-natured. I think he was the main reason I enjoyed the class so much. The subject was not hard and pretty interesting. Since it was a survey course, there were some things I found more interesting than others, but thats ok. The workload for this class is VERY LIGHT the majority of the time. The only time you really have to work hard is for the 5 assignments that tend to be pretty difficult. But, the TAs and Prof. Ernst are always happy to answer questions. Exams are generally pretty easy, and Prof Ernst is a lenient grader. This is a good class to have a friend in. It makes it a lot easier to study some of the more difficult things when you can help each other grasp the concepts. Basically, take the class! It is fun, interesting, and a great way to get a QDS.
@

/course/1956
Ernst is a wonderful professor; he learned everyone's names within the first couple classes and made the class feel much smaller than it actually was. His objectives were clear; this class is a great way to get a feel for the different areas of linguistics, or to get a QDS while altering your basic perception of the way human language works. The homework was interesting and very helpful in learning the material (although be prepared, even though the homework was straight-forward it could be quite time-consuming). The exams were extremely fair, relying mostly in material covered in class while also asking some reach questions that required applying your knowledge, not merely regurgitating it. Although everything I'd heard about Ling 1 in the past was about Pulju as a professor, I can't imagine wanting to take this class with anyone else! Take this class with Ernst, you will not be disappointed!
@
Thomas Ernst
/course/1956
If you're looking for an easy QDS, this is it.  Most of the class is based on homeworks, which are fairly easy - I think there were 5 total.  And then there are two midterms and a quiz, all doable if you did the reading and did well on the homework.  That being said, there is very little reading and no reason not to do it.  If you pay attention to the lectures, which are pretty entertaining, it reinforces the reading and you barely have to study for the tests.  Ernst is really passionate about what he teaches and you can tell by his lectures.  A lot of people say that Pulju is more fun to have for Ling 001, but I thought that Ernst was a really good professor and he really tried hard to be entertaining.

Good overview of many linguistic subtopics, but I've had enough of "overview/intro courses" for now... But if that is what you are looking for, this is one of the better intros. Ernst is animated and fairly engaging in a large lecture class, and the readings are comprehensive (class sticks to reading materials pretty well for the most part)
@

Ernst was cool and pretty funny, but his exams and assignments are pretty brutal, so don't go looking for an easy A in a QDS distrib here. The course definitely requires a legitimate amount of time and effort, which I didn't realize until too late and was really unhappy with my grade. Not a bad course, though, but the material gets kind of dry at times.
@

Not much to say about this.  The material is fun and interesting if you're a word nerd (and probably one of the best way to get a QDS if you're not a math person).  It's an introductory course, and designed to be pretty easy.  Ernst is a good professor, and a fair grader.  I recommend the course.

I thought I might think ling was interesting.  Nothing wrong with the subject, but just not my cup of tea.  Found it a bit boring, which made it harder to do well since it isn't totally intuitive.  At least I don't have to take math now.  Ernst was a good lecturer, very animated.

Professor Ernst is an awesome professor, he gives great lectures that are easy to follow and interesting to listen to. I signed up for the class just to learn about something I knew nothing about, and I ended up enjoying it. With a different professor, I don't think I would have likes linguistics at all. The reading is necessary, but definitely bearable. The homeworks are hard, but they're graded fairly, as are the tests. Overall, I'm glad I took the course.

Dave is a cool dude, a little monotone. It's not too hard, Dave doesn't mess with you by making anything much harder on the exams than what you were expecting. I guess get the textbook, but if you can get through most classes without reading, you can get through this class without reading. Just go to class. Go to the TA sessions if you're having trouble. Hang out in Reed Hall. Some people just don't like ling, but for a QDS it's way layup-y.

This a great class if you are looking to escape the math department in the pursuit of the QDS distributive.  But if you are going to take Ling 1, I would try to take it with Pulju (awesome!!!!) or some other prof besides Peterson.  Linguistics isn't very difficult to pick up.  I took an upper level class before taking this intro class and ended up being fine.  But there is a lot of memorization that you MUST do, and if you are going to skip the reading then go to the lectures.  The lecture material is   85% of what you see on the tests. Buy the study guide that comes with the book.  The first third of the class you won't need it, but halfway through the material and the problems (it's kinda like math/ logic but with words and sounds) get tougher.   Peterson isn't a bad guy, in fact he told us to call him Dave.  However, he is an awful lecturer. He speaks in a monotone, flips through slides to fast, and always goes over on class time.  The power points are NOT posted on blackboard, so you need to be able to take fast, good notes or know someone else in the class that does.  And he will cover simple problems in class and then put harder problems on the graded homework and the midterms/ final, so you never quite feel like you have learned enough to do fantastically on the tests.  If you don't know what you are doing, consult a t.a. or Peterson immediately!!! They will help you! Also, don't worry about how bad your grades seem to be.  The class gets a bit curved in the end.    This class can be really boring at times.  But don't let it turn you of to linguistics.  There are some great upper level classes that are awesome!

I went into this course thinking that linguistics would be an interesting academic pursuit, despite being a relatively obscure subject.  However, I was totally disappointed. The professor failed to inspire any interest whatsoever in the subject, and as a result the class was merely boring and tedious. The few topics that were interesting were those that were not emphasized or tested, and thus the class was overall painful and boring.
@
David Peterson
/course/1956
Although the course material may be interesting if taught by another prof, Professor Peterson is a terribly boring lecturer. He spends practically half of each class going over the little material he covered in the last class. The lectures are often so boring that they make attempting the material during class a real pain. You have to spend a good amount of time outside class figuring out what Peterson was trying to explain during class. Between midterms and the final there was little work, though Peterson does like to surprise the class randomly and collect the informal homework assignments. Formal assignments were a every couple of weeks and were a good way to be forced to learn the material. The textbook is confusing sometimes.  On the whole, the material was pretty interesting, but Peterson did little to motivate my interest. I would recommend the course, but definitely with a different professor.
@
David Peterson
/course/1956
As this was an introductory course, we should have covered the various types of linguistics in relative equality. Instead, we focused on the much less interesting and more analytical parts of the subject (sentence trees, excessive analysis, etc.). Prof. Peterson is not a good lecturer and did not make me want to pursue linguistics. The powerpoints were too fast to take good notes from and the exams were significantly more difficult than anything we had done in class.

...the man can't teach.  Everything that comes out of his mouth is collectively contradictory, arbitrary, and/or senseless.  There is no rhyme or reason to this man's approach to Linguistics.  Avoid him like the plague; take Ling 1 with other profs.  Lenore is cold, unapproachable, and a bit arrogant -- to be honest.  She was a great lecturer but not very nice to work with.  Ling 1 is an easy QDS and I got an awesome grade thanks to my self-study skills, but I say take another section of Ling 1 with another teacher and save yourself the pain of Donny (Peterson) & Marie's (Grenoble's) insufferable antics.

Don't know why I took this class.  It was mildly interesting at times, but we mostly skipped over the interesting parts.  The course was team-taught by Profs. Peterson and Grenoble.  It seemed to be a difficult pairing.  They often bantered uncomfortably, and didn't always (or ever) know who was going to talk about what topic.  Grenoble was a better lecturer.  Grading was fine, so go ahead and take it if you need a QDS.

You think its going to be easy. really isn't. well, it should be, but any class as boring as ling 1 (taught by peterson and grenoble) kills brains cells instead of developing them, therefore making the class unnecessarly difficult.

I found this class very interesting. The only thing is that it was very frustrating having Prof Peterson as a lecturer. He often gets off topic, thus lectures get boring and frustrating. Prof Grenoble was great on the other hand. Her lectures were interactive and fun. Unfortunately she wasn't around much to give lectures; thus it ended up being mostly Prof Peterson.

I liked the material for this course but I thought it was taught really poorly.  When Professors Peterson and Grenoble teach together, absolutely nothing gets done.  They are constantly bickering and contradicting each other.  When Professor Peterson teaches alone, it's still not much better.  Not only is he not effective getting the material across in class, but he's not helpful in office hours either.  When I asked questions, he mostly just directed me to the book, which I had already read and reread.

the class is easy.  if you don't get great scores on exams, don't freak out  grades are curved, even though i didn't know it until i got my final grade.  peterson is very nice, but slightly boring.  it's more of his style of lecturing than what he's saying.  he's very bright and quick.  he has a cute earring.  lenore grenoble is a good speaker, not as innovative and penetrating as peterson is, though.  she seems nice under the 'hard face' facade.

I took Ling 1 in Spring 06 for the QDS requirement after my abysmal performance in Math 8 in fall guaranteed I wasn't gonna get the distrib there. Like most others in the class, we weren't expecting it to be difficult, and for the most part it wasn't...if you can stay awake. Professor Peterson and Grenoble attempted co-teaching the class many times, but only managed to make new material more confusing by trying to be witty and funny. However, if you can get yourself into the material and don't underestimate the exams, you should do fine. It's not meant to be a "weeder" class - the profs know perfectly well that most students are only taking it for the elusive QDS. For me, definitely a better option than math, and although I ended up with a slightly-below-median grade, I'm happy with it and I feel it basically reflects the amount of effort I put into it.

Admittedly, Professor Whaley warned us on the first day introductory does not mean easy. He reminded us of that fact repeatedly in this class, which was a roller coaster to say the least. After hooking us with manageable topics, the class deteriorated into a muddle of increasingly complicated topics, each of which was less comprehensible than the last. I spent more than 10 hours on each problem set, and probably 20 on the midterm. And my grades were horrendously low, unassisted by the linguistic geniuses in the class. I was disappointed- I expected this to be an interesting, fun class. Instead, I barely passed. This is not worth it for the distrib. But if you are genuinely interested, and are prepared to dedicate your life to this course, they take it by all means.

Ling 1 is an interesting course which provides a good deal of exposure to Lingusitic studies which is a suprisingly entertaining subject area. This course is not super easy, and while it often has little to no homework, the problem sets take a good deal of time (there are only 4 of them, which is nice).  This course will require effort.  Professor Whaley is outstanding.  He loves the subject, is enthusiastic, and an excellent teacher.
@

Professor Whaley is a great lecturer.  Though we were a pretty big class, he encouraged our questions and responded to each and every raised hand.      Our grades were made up of three quizzes, four problem sets, and a midterm and final exam.  We started off studying phonetics, then worked our way up to phonology, morphology and syntax, with some special topics (on dialects and animal communication, for example) along the way.     The problems on the homeworks, midterm and final, however, were significantly harder than those we discussed in class, to the extent that the TAs were always bombarded by students during office hours.  I agree that exams and homework should be challenging, but sometimes it got to be ridiculous. I wish that Professor Whaley had discussed more challenging problems in class, if only to open our minds to a greater number of possible solutions.  I often couldn't come up with an answer because I didn't even know that such a solution was possible.  On the whole, the course was fascinating and made me want to take more Linguistics classes.  I would recommend taking any of Whaley's classes if they're offered--he's just a really cool guy in and outside of class.

Professor Whaley definitely made this course.  The information was interesting just because it is so different from anything i'd ever learned, but Whaley's random stories and clear way of teaching made the class even better.

I wish I had known That you can get sooooooooooooo much help on the problem sets. Had I known this I would have aced the course. The key to doing well in ling 01 is doing the problem sets as soon as your get them even if you ahve a week to do them) and getting going to ev every scheduled office hour and seeting up an appointment with the prof. Prof Whaley is awesome and very willing to help. If you dont know even how to start the problems sets (WHICH WAS USUALLY MY CASE) then you can blitz the TA's, and then meet with the prof. This is the kind of material that you can work on for a little bit everyday.  It cannot be done the night before, like history!!!!!! The Professor is awesome, an interesting lecturer. This course is strongly recommended for anybody. Just please, take my advice and avoid dying a frustrated academic death.

1. Yes. It lived up to my expectation that it would be time-consuming.  2. The class contributed to my education. I definitely would not have taken this class unless I needed the QDS it is providing for me.  3. I don't know if it was the course or the professor, but this class seemed much too hard for an intro-level course, in terms of time committment.  I was frustrated by this course. We did not learn a system for doing most of the homework, thus causing a lot of guesswork. VERY frustrating.   The final was unfair. It took too much time. If you were to multiply the time it took by 3 (the typical number of classes most students take),  you would have no way of finishing your finals on time.

From my understanding, many students at Dartmouth who are not "gifted" in the arenas of math tend to take Linguistics 1 to fulfill their QDS and avoid Math 5 - the only other students who need the course would be either modified majors, cognitive science majors, or linguistics majors (a minute percentage of the dartmouth community.) I signed up for the course with the understanding that it would be a good deal of work but very interesting - I had hoped to have an "intro" to the study of linguistics, the application of various types of logic to dying languages.   Under the auspices of Prof. Whaley, Ling 1 took on the characteristics of any other "weeder" course at Dartmouth (Math 5, CS 5...courses meant to weed out the weaker links from that department), and as a result, became an incredibly difficult and time-consuming course.   From my understanding, Whaley is a great professor for higher level courses, specialty topics in linguistics taught to a smaller group of students, not the 80+ students in Dartmouth 105.   Apparently, the class was not meeting Whaley's expectations, and he would let us know about his disappointment with the class' performance on problem sets and other course work.   The problem sets became quite the effort - the workshops meant to help cement the concepts were not very helpful.  The issues were glossed over, and then the data/problems in the problem sets were much more difficult and complex than the ones briefly presented during the workshops.  I was spending about 8-12 hours on each problem set, even when working with other students - I shudder to think of how long it would have taken me to do it alone. The final was another story, given out on the last Monday of classes, due that Friday at 930 am - this would have worked out so well had I not had any other work to do during finals period - the amount of time devoted to this "take home" final seriously interfered with my work for other courses. Lectures were not very helpful - Whaley was very enthusiastic to answer students' questions, but was so eager that the actual lectures got sidetracked, and we would spend about 25 mins of the class time on that day's actual topic. All in all, this intro course became an incredibly difficult and time consuming course, and it did not help to have a professor berating the students for not doing "really well" on the assignments.  The grading was incredibly strict. If you're looking at Linguistics 1 as an option for your QDS - please take this into account...it might be more trouble than its worth.

I really enjoyed this class, but I can see how some people found it really difficult.  It really works well for people who are logical thinkers.  I found the problem sets to be like puzzles to figure out.  But I guess they did take a fair amount of time and were especially frustrating for people who put a lot of time in and ended up missing a lot.  One other thing that made the class kind of difficult was that it was hard to know exactly what was expected and what you were supposed to do for each assignment.

If you're really interested in Ling, take this class with Stanford! He's super sweet and really freaking amazing. I loved him as my Ling prof and he made the class so interesting and fun to learn. The quizzes aren't hard unless you decide not to study at all. The tests aren't bad either, just make sure you try to review all the concept he goes over (even quotes) because they might pop up. Take the class!

If you want to take this class, TAKE IT WITH STANFORD!!! He's such a nice and understanding person and he really wants to see his students succeed. He's extremely approachable, easy to talk to, and eager to help. He's an engaging prof which makes it hard not to pay attention in his class. I also found the class material very interesting. The quizzes are straightforward and as long as you're paying attention in class and looking over your notes, you should be fine. There are five homework assignments throughout the term and the trick to doing well on those is to go to the TA office hours or study groups to work with other people. There are 3 tests as well. The first two aren't cumulative and the third one is, but they're all still weighted the same. The key to doing well on the tests is to take detailed notes in class and study those. Overall, I'd highly recommend this class and Stanford as a prof!!!

Professor Stanford is phenomenal. He is super available, funny, and makes an effort to become acquainted with all 80 of his students within the first week. Class material was fairly straightforward and interesting - pretty easy aside from the more complex syntax trees. Workload took no more than 2 hours per week. Easy QDS distrib.

Course Very well-paced, and the linguistic puzzle-like exercises are fun to do!  Professor Prof. Stanford is DA BOMB! He's so hilarious and such a nice guy!  Workload The workload was fine. The exams don't require that much studying if you pay attention in class. There are problem-set like homeworks throughout the term that are manageable and doable in one day.

Jim Stanford is very enthusiastic about his subject, and does a great job teaching it. He covers a wide range of linguistic topics for a wide range of diverse students, at a good steady pace, open to review and furthur explanation.  There's takehome assignments every other week or so that really help reinforce the material, then 2 bigger tests and the final exam. There's reading from the textbook before each class, but though it helps to read it and it's wellwritten, you can get by on the lectures alone, cuz they're so great!  EVERYBODY should take this class, whether they're into math, science, foreign languages, history, humanities, whatever. You WILL love it!

Class was okay. Not much of a layup as I thought. But if you go to class put in just a couple hours into the course a week, you should be fine.  Professor McPherson isn't the best lecturer, but she does try hard and cares a lot for her students!

I thought this class was great. McPherson knew everyone's name and made class interesting and interactive. She's obviously really knowledgeable about what she's teaching and class was always fun to go to. She responded to blitz really quickly and always answered questions in class. Highly recommend her and the class, although the class moved really quickly and covered a ton of material. Easy to fall behind.

Professor Riley is the best! He is so calm and kind and he makes an effort to encourage everyone, regardless of their skill. He makes lessons very clear and introduces different skills and techniques step by step. He does also push you at times to get you to out of your comfort zone and think outside the box on your projects. I wouldn't call this class a layup, because of the intense amount of time involved (15 hours a week in the studio outside of class) but because I learned so much in such a short period of time, I'm definitely glad I took it.
@
Enrico Riley
/course/2744
Riley is the best professor to have for this class. He encourages everyone, regardless of their personal art style or level. If you have never taken art or are a horrible drawer, he will encourage you, being kind with his critiques and helping you with different exercises that will transform you into someone who uses their own style. If you are an accomplished artist, he will let you explore different avenues on your own and critique you fairly.  He's a very easy grader, but I would say that everyone in my class spent a lot of time on their work (as is necessary, in any art class.) I went into this class thinking that drawing was just messing around with a pencil or maybe some other tool with paper- Riley really taught me a bit about what art is.
@
Enrico Riley
/course/2744
My drawing skills improved significantly and Prof. Riley helped me to, for the first time, look at my work from an intellectual point of view. The class was a great release from the dreary New Hampshire winter. Lots of work? Yes. Worth it? Completely.  A word of warning, though don't try to sleep on the couches while pulling an all-nighter in the Hop. S&S will find you, ask for ID, and threaten to write you up.

Prof. Riley is a dream art prof; very funny, very bright, and very sensitive to what students are looking for in a studio art class at a liberal arts institution. He was a former Dartmouth student and "gets it," but he's no pushover. Try to be in his section.
@
Enrico Riley

If you are going to take this class you better have a passion for drawing because it will take passion and genuine love for drawing to keep you awake at night finishing the crazy workload of this class!  The class itself is well structured, and well-ran. The only problem is that you will have to do LOTS of drawing (which often demand a lot of outside of class time if you aspire to get a good grade), and will pose a challenge if you are taking other classes that also demand a lot of your time. (I would recommend taking this class during a term you have less demanding classes so that you don't go out of your mind juggling the intense workload).  The activities drawing in class and critiquing others' work as well as your own in front of class, mastering techquines, drawing still life, drawing models, and doing a final major project (a huge poster)that demonstrates your mastery of all the techniques learned in the course.  Prof Riley is a bit introverted but he is not altogether unapproachable, so do speak to him whenever you don't understand something as he will be happy to explain things to you.

this course is over all interesting and enjoyable. the assignments are challenging and interesting, and the critiques give some good insight. however, the fact that your work hangs on the wall every week definitely creates some stress. i found it extremely difficult to do the assignment quickly, even if i had a bunch of other things to do. professory riley is really nice, but sometimes it is difficult to see what he wants, as he doesn't really point out what you need to improve.
@
Enrico Riley
/course/2744
I took this class on a whim but it ranks among my favorites at Dartmouth. I loved spending time in the studio even though I'm not a minor or major and have minimal experience drawing.   Enrico is a good person and great teacher. You build a foundation with the basics before tackling assignments that seemed way beyond your reach when you're just starting. Everyone in my class improved during the term. Some struggled with various concepts more than others, but I think most of us performed better than expected. Many people believe they can't draw because they've never devoted 5+ hrs to a drawing.   On that note, it does take up a lot of time but I'd rather spend 6 hrs on a drawing than 2 on a paper. It's time well spent.
@

Enrico Riley is a really amazing teacher.  It doesn't matter if you're a beginner or have a lot of experience, he's great at explaining the concepts so that you really understand them and can carry them out in your own work.  You make the assignments fit your level and it's an awesome thing to see how much everyone is the class progresses.  There is a pretty good amount of studio time involved, but the effort really pays off when you see what you can create and the professor definitely acknowledges your dedication even if you aren't the most gifted.

Studio art classes are very time-consuming!  That said, they are worth the effort.  You don't have to be an artist to do well, you just have to do the assignments and show up to class.  Enrico is a great teacher and artist and has meaningful comments for everyone.  He takes a more hands off approach to teaching, letting us critique each other's work before adding his own comments.  The homework assignments oftern took hours, but they would usually be assigned on thursday and due tuesday so we had a long time to get them done.  Drawing is a great skill to have, so if you can put in the time for this course, I highly recommend it.

When as space opened up for me in the class, and I sat in for a day, I though Riley was a little too mellow for me and I almost dropped. I'm glad I stuck with it. He takes a while to unfold, but he does and he has suggestions for people with all levels of experience.   I already had art before so I admit some of the assignments  seemed a little unoriginal. But those of you with art experience--you're going to have to take a drawing I to get to higher levels, and always know that Riley will have both compliments and criticism for you. Be prepared to you lots of charcole!!! Charcole was fun for me but just know you don't branch out a lot with media in this class.

I've already taken this course at an art college.  In comparison, Riley's class is not as demanding in time or perfection of pieces.  So while I did not improve as much in this course as I had in the one elsewhere, I really enjoyed Riley's openness and love of all art; he found beauty not just in the most accurate of drawings but in all of them.  In comparison to the rest of the professors who taught Drawing I, the work load for this class seemed significantly less.

Enrico is an extremely easy going guy. This helps out because drawing 1 can be especially intimidating for people that have no experience whatsoever.  He does a good job of finding the strengths of any drawing, making class critics less intimidating. But at the same time, it's hard to get real criticism from him, which can be a problem if you are want to really improve.  You'll be spending a lot of time in the studio for assignments. Though it's much more fun to be working on a drawing than writing an essay.
@
Enrico Riley
/course/2744
Drawing 1 is a lot of work, but it is a different workload than other courses.  All homework is drawing in the studio.  Prof. Riley was outstanding, with helpful critiques and appropriate assignments.  Any who are interested should take this course
@

Riley is a cool guy and a great prof. He also doesn't give weird, obscure assignments like I've heard the other drawing-1 profs give.

I liked this class, it was a solid introductory drawing class.  The only problem was that I had extensive experience with drawing before coming to Dartmouth and there is no way to place out of drawing 1 so I felt a bit bored at times, but Professor Riley was mostly accomodating and he tried to make the class interesting and challenging anyway.  If you want a good introduction to drawing or are interested in studio art, this is a fine course to take.  The only thing was, Professor Riley was really nice about everyone's artwork even if it was utter crap, he still tried to find something positive to say about it.  also, he didn't really give anyone criticism of what they were doing wrong, so some people had a hard time with getting past mistakes that they repeatedly made.  But in the end, everyone had improved significantly in their drawing abilities.  I think professor Riley's greatest strength as a professor is that he often brought in books of artwork in to class and had brilliantly insightful comments to say about the artwork he was talking about.  Probably the one thing I took away from this class more than anything else was a new appreciation for great artists of the past, some of whom before I had not been able to understand the value of their work, but after the course, loved their art.  This was a fun and relaxing class and I enjoyed it.

I learned to draw.  How astonishing and wonderful.  I think that the hours I spent on my drawings were some of my best-spent hours at Dartmouth.  Professor Riley is an excellent art teacher.  His sequence of exercises really builds skills.  And, even better, he and the art he showed us were inspiring.
@
Enrico Riley
/course/2744
After the first couple of class, I was considering dropping it because, first, I had no other previous drawing experience, secondly, I was too concerned that all my drawings looked ugly.  However, this class slowly became my favorite class of the term.  It was partly due to Professor Riley.  He's so cool.  He's really nice and understands that people have different abilities.  His lessons, combined with the work you do in class and for homework really helped me become better in drawing and more confident in my drawings, that is if you pay attention and try really hard.  I spent a lot of time on the homeworks because you have to display them at the beginning of class and talk about them, so you have to them really good, you can't half ass it or else it's extremely embarrasing.  Also, some of the homework assignments are set stuff you have to draw, however there is plenty of room for personal expression, which is really cool.

Enrico Riley

I was extremely lucky to be placed in Riley's session.  The other sections had homework assignments that were tedious and in areas I wouldn't have been interested in.  In Riley's class, we did many still life studies of contour, value, positive and negative space, did some drawing from a model, practiced capturing the emotion of a human face, learned to draw draperies, did an enlargement of a Rembrandt, and even had some free assignments.  I have never had so much fun in a class.  I was passionate about art to begin with, but I feel this class really allowed me to express myself and to develop my skills with charcoal and other medium.  I feel I got better at representing the human figure, and I enjoyed myself while doing so.  Other sections focused a lot on collage techniques and plants, but I feel we focused on topics relevant to the typical sort of art I would be interested in pursuing.  There is a lot of time needed outside of class for assignments, but in the end they were so fulfilling it was worth it.
@
Enrico Riley
/course/2744
without having any drawing experience and only wanting to get a prerequisite for another course, I went into drawing with a neutral attitude.  But the course was very well-taught - professor riley is one of the cooler drawing profs.  He didn't assign us impossible homework, although it was pretty challenging - the crumpled-up paper assignment was tedious, and so is having a long assignment that you're expected to spend 4 hours on.  the most difficult part of the course is having the motivation to go and spend 2 or 3 hours on a drawing outside of class; that was the most difficult part of it for me, because the class is labor-intensive.  it doesn't take much thinking, but after completing a drawing I was completely exhausted.  I am definitely glad I took this course, though, because it really helped me strengthen my visual sense in terms of how i view value, line, etc.  and it offered me a different approach to drawing than I had before.
@
Enrico Riley
/course/2744
All in all, this was an excellent introduction to Drawing for someone who has never had the talent or training for art before.  While my grade obviously paled in comparison to my quite-skilled peers, Prof Riley still treated my work with dignity and useful analysis.
@
Enrico Riley
/course/2744
This course really does teach you "how" to draw.  Professor Riley goes step by step, starting with basic outline drawing to more complicated figure drawing.  It's a building process. There isn't that much room, however, for abstract drawing.  The course focuses heavily on technique.  So, you will learn how to draw, but you may not have as much freedom in what you draw for your assignments. Still, it was a lot of fun and I recommend it to everyone who has an interest.
@

This class is A TON of work--be prepared to spend up to 4-5 hours on each night's homework assignment.   Enrico is a great guy, and the atmosphere/deadlines are very relaxed. If you miss a class, though, it becomes troublesome...

This is an awesome class that everyone should take.  It is a lot of work, but drawing doesn't really entail thinking.  Riley is a new prof i think and he didnt give as much hmwk as the other teachers.  He's pretty good and the class is easy, if you are good at art and/or if you put a lot fo time into it.  the best part about the class is that there is no reading or essay writing involved.

The hardest thing was just getting the concepts. The prof making abstract statements like "Draw the light" can be really frustrating until you get it. It kind of clicks at some point in the term. But it's really not as bad as people say. The night or two before a big project is due, yes, you'll be in the studio kind of late, but as long as you keep up with the drawings it's really not much time at all. Be willing to experiment and do lots of erasing!

at first there were a lot of assignments that weren't particularly interesting, but the second half of the class was more open ended so they were as interesting as you made them.  If you take this class try not to leave all the work until the night before becuase it sucks pretty hard.
@
Colleen Randall
/course/2744
In the beginning, you feel that other drawing classes are doing so much more than you, and better stuff. At the end of this class however, I think I really understood her PROCESS, which was to help US find our own styles. And I did. It was fun exploring.I feel though, that she is a better professor for those who already have a strong sense of art and artistic technique. For those who have to struggle harder to "get" it, there is less imporvemnt.
@

This course is an amazingly enjoyable time sink. It's absolutely wonderful to have a reason to spend hours and hours drawing, but DO NOT take it with other time intensive courses. It becomes much more stressful than it ought to be. I made the mistake of taking it with THE most time intensive Lab Bio course this side of the FSP.   Colleen is the dept chair, and I've definitely gotten the impression that she's much more strict than some of the other profs in the dept--and she is a horrible lecturer--but she's really good at pushing you to be better. You can tell when she's displeased with what you've done pretty easily.

I had more homework in this class per week than I did in my math and english class combined.  Spending a month doing figure drawings wasn't exactly the greatest....but I learned a lot and my drawings really improved throughout the term.  If you really want to learn how to draw well and have the time to put into this class I'd go for it...but I'm pretty sure that the other drawing profs don't assign as much work.

@
Colleen Randall
/course/2744
Although she expects you to put in 10 hrs out of class a week, no one really does. People usually spend about 6 at most at the start, and even less when assignments change from five small drawing to 1 big drawing. It made me a better artist, but the prof isn't fully able to describe art work (whats good and bad about it) in a vocabularly that the non-artist can understand. she does have the artist mentatlity that people shouldn't restrict art, and, thus, students could bend the assignments to their preferences.
@
Colleen Randall
/course/2744
I am really glad that I've taken this course.  It requires a lot time but also allow you do a different kind of work so you can get away from your typical course workload.  Randall is a very generous grader and I recommend this course to anyone with interest in art/drawing even if you have no experience at all.
@
Colleen Randall
/course/2744
So, its Drawing 1. If you're going to take almost anything else in Studio Art, you have to take it. And the class has to teach you certain things. So, within these limitations, it was altogether not a bad course. Very work intensive. You have to be prepared to spending long hours working on your drawings in the second half of the class. But I, for one, felt like they were hours well spent. Professor Randall is great. She is very helpful in class and encourages questions.  In short, I'm glad I took the class and Im glad I had Colleen as my Prof.
@
Colleen Randall
/course/2744
The class was interesting, but often Prof.  Randall would tell you you needed to fix an aspect of your drawing, but not offer many ways of how to do that until you asked her.  But when you asked her, she'd help you out.  To do well in the course, you need to spend a lot of time outside of class on your drawings.  Often I would do my drawing the night before, only put 4 hours into it, and then the next day when we hung all our drawings up in class for critiques, my drawing would look less-worked on than others.  You need to have time during the week to really spend on the drawings, especially near the end of the term.  Good course.
@
Colleen Randall
/course/2744
It was not a particularly bad course, but not too exciting, either.  Working in art makes grading a whimsical-seeming process, and selling yourself, as opposed to your results, a necessity.  Furthermore, working in black and white will force you to curse the limitations of a gray-scale color-scheme, but at the same time be glad you don't have to worry about all the other colors.  In addition, your self confidence may not be helped much by this course, because while you may slave over works, they seem to have a tendancy to fall short of expectations.
@
Colleen Randall

I really loved this course, but it is not at all an easy class. The assignments take a huge amount of time and if you aren't taking this class for love of drawing or art it can get pretty frustrating. I really enjoyed Professor Randall and thought her assignments were creative and challenging.

But an interesting class to take, especially to get away from the typical course.

The class was good, but definitely a lot of work.  The assignments are definitely not small, and they require a lot of effort; sometimes more than you would expect.  Prof. Randall was helpful if you ask for her help.  If you don't say anything or ask her any questions, she won't say much to you.  I don't think her comments were very helpful, but at least she was very open-minded.  It's a good idea to have a bit of extra time in your schedule to be able to finish all of the assignments.

you ahve to put in a lto of tiem, but this is a great. class  if you think you are at all interested in art, take this class asap, since its a pre req for all other studio art classes except for sculpture.  and despite the complaints from photo kids, it really will help you if you want to take photo classes. you learna bout composition and the history of art in this class (colleen takes you to the hood museum to look at other drawings during a couple of the X hours)  if you put in the time, you will do fine in the class. she really works with you to bring out your own strengths (we all have them believe it or not)  so dont be afraid to take this class because you dont think you have enough art skills.

Although it's true that this class will not make a master artist out of everyone, it really does teach you how to draw well.  In this class, I learned a lot about how a work of art . . . well, works.  This class will really open your eyes to a new understanding of art and of your visual perceptions of the world in general.  Professor Randall really helped me improve as an artist. She seemed to consider the "spatial" considerations of a drawing to the exclusion of many other concerns, but I found that this approach helped me learn to understand art a lot better.   PS.  Don't avoid this class because you "can't draw."  Everyone can.

She's so quirky and sweet, but she literally doesn't understand the fact that human beings can be sick. I had the flu for a week and was bed-ridden, but she specifically lowered my grade because I didn't come to class. She told me my art deserved an A, but because I missed two classes, she had to mark me down. Professor Thompson also assigns a ridiculous amount of work. She asked us to complete a 3 panel drawing between Tuesday and Thursday multiple times. Don't take this class with her.
@
Pamela Thompson
/course/2744
This class is absolutely NOT a layup. Not only did we have hours of homework every week, but Professor Thompson gave very little insight on how to improve drawing skills, leaving students to do their own research outside of class or spend more and more time in the art studio trying to improve their work. I cannot remember a single lecture on how to draw the human body or how to vary line texture, etc. While I took this class to fill the art distrib, I really wish I had taken another class. I enjoyed art and also enjoyed being in the art studio, but the amount of time I had to spend working on the art projects was incredibly stressful, and walking all the way to the BVAC every time I wanted to change just one thing was tedious and tiring.
@

/course/2744
Don't believe your trip leaders when they tell you this class is a layup (shoutout I791). I spent more time in the art studio than in my own dorm room because Thompson assigns so much work. That being said, she is a great prof and really works to help you improve (regardless of whether you enter this class with previous art experience). Overall, I would recommend this class, but not if you already have a heavy work load or if you're just looking for a layup.

This class is a lot of work, many many hours, though it is not very straining.

Professor Thompson didn't take the time to give any sort of lessons or demos, instead she just gave us a subject and told us to draw. While this worked for those in the class who had a lot of talent or had already taken classes, it was ineffective for the beginners. Professor Thompson was also a very subjective grader and did not grade at all based on effort. I suggest taking this class from a different professor if you are a beginner, or not confident in your drawing abilities.
@
Pamela Thompson
/course/2744
I hadn't done "art" since junior high.  That wasn't a problem here.  No experience/knowledge is necessary.  You just draw. You will improve greatly simply based on how much time you spend drawing. The prof doesn't really teach techniques, but that isn't always a bad thing. Sometimes, she's a little flaky, so you don't have to follow the assignments exactly, just be confident in whatever you do. Also, she allows you to branch out from pencil/charcoal on a few assignments, which is very nice by the end of the term.

This is a GREAT class. The prof is very nice and good at helping you really develop your drawing skills. I had never taken a drawing class before, but that hardly mattered. I would reccomend this class for anyone needing to get their art distib out of the way. but, be warned, this class can eat up a lot of time.

I wouldn't recommend taking this course if it's only for an art distrib- it's a beginner course, but a majority of the students have had some previous art and are planning on taking more art. It's a lot of time outside the class; this is not an easy third course. The grading is pretty fair (with Professor Thompson) but it's still a lot of time and patience that you may not have.

The first day of class, Professor Thompson told us to expect to draw at least two hours a day outside of class.  The time commitment wasn't quite this much, but there were some very long stretches spent in the drawing studios.   Thompson has plenty to say, but doesn't explain drawing techniques well.  Her lightheartedness, clear interest in the arts, and accommodating personality, however, definitely benefit her students.

This was a really amazing class.  I never before considered myself to be artistic or had any artistic leanings, but I'm now considering a studio art minor.  Professor Thompson looked at all our work based on our won skills and worked to help each of us improve as best we could.  She didn't compare students to each other, instead concentrating on individuals, which was really important, though slightly difficult considering how large our class was.  I strongly recommend this course, even, maybe especially, to those who don't think that they have any artistic talent.  You may surprise yourself by the end.

This class can be as time consuming as you would like it to be. You can certainly get by without putting too much effort into your drawings but the more time you put into the class, the more rewarding it will be. Esme is a great person and can be a great teacher, however, students need to ask questions about their work in order for her to explain drawing techniques. Also, you get really dirty in class. My fingers were black from charcoal pretty much all term and it would take the days between classes for the charcoal to finally wear off only to get dirty in class again. Other then the dirty factor, I think this was a great class and would definitely recommend it to other students, especially if Esme is teaching it.

This class will take an incredible amount of your time.  Each assignment regardless of skill level takes at least three hours to complete.  The course does however help improve every students drawing ability dramaticaly.  The assignments were rather boring in the begininning, but became really involving as the class went on.  The emphasis on drawing portraits was fantastic as it was easy to learn to draw faces well even with having previously zero proficiency.  I would recommend this class to everyone that has the time to take it, as the professor passionatly and proficiently improves the skills of all students.

One of the best art teachers I've ever had-  made it easy to enjoy the class for every level of student, absolutely inspiring and really supportive of everyone's creativity. Thompson really made the class, I had friends in other sections who hated it because of their profs.  Work-wise the homework assignments are really time-consuming and I ended up spending anywhere from 2-5 hours in the studio for each one.  My only complaint would be that the assignments for Tues classes and those for Thurs classes required the same amount of time, despite having more time for the Tues homework (Thursday night/Fri/Sat/Sun/Mon) as the Thursday homework (Tues night/Wed) since it was a 10A class. I do have to say that the time spent in the studio goes much faster than one would expect, its not like spending 2-5 hours studying history or something.  The assignments were really interesting and fun, even for someone who has taken a lot of art before.  Highly recommend it.

Professor Thompson is really nice and she grades based on improvement so I'd recommend this class to anyone who has an interest in drawing even if you think you're horrible or have never taken an art class before like me. But like I said, it's time consuming.
@

...so much so, my hands were grimy *all term*. It would take the days between classes to finally wear off, only to be replaced again.  Anyways, the class itself was fine. I find the act of drawing soothing, but I wish I could have learned something more practical about style during this course. As a n00b, I had no idea about technique, and it never really was elaborated upon. The weeks of doing the same still-lifes repeatedly became somewhat grating. The homework was something that needed to be done regularly, or one risked falling behind and being buried under it. I still had a good time, but I don't feel that I grew at all as an artist (even just as a green one).

Professor Thompson has a true passion for art and as a result she not only is able to see beauty in every work that a student produces, but she also has high expectations.  The hours that students put into the assignments are well worth the effort, though.  Your skill at drawing is dramatically improved by the end of the term if you actually take the time to practice your art.  The course was only this good because Professor Thompson imbued it with her enthusiasm and extensive background knowledge of art.  Note This course should not be taken unless your other courses leave you enough time to really focus on your drawings.

Lots of work but an excellent course to take during the summer.  The prof is very responsive and encouraging.  No matter what your skill level, she is positive and wants you to do well.  But, be prepared to put in the hours in the studio!    Toughest part of every week is the Tue.-Thurs. assignments.

Take this class even if you think you can't draw - I did and it was a great experience. Prof. Thompson is a great teacher - you'll learn new ways to look at your world! Don't let your insecurities prevent you from trying this.

Thompson will make you work really hard. Expect to have an unreasonable amount of homework. For our class we were really gung-ho about the class during the 1st half of the class, but enthusiasm waned as the mountains of drawing homework continued to pile on.  Consequently, you'll learn alot about drawing and you may be doing more work than the other drawing 1 classes, but you will also be improving the most.  There were some late nights pulled in the hop drawing and finishing up homework. it was a bonding experience for the class i think.

i thought this class would be more fun, more interesting, and more informative than it was. the class was a lot of drawing from observation and not much creative work. prof walp isn't very effective when explaining concepts. i felt like we were just jumping from one concept to the next with no big picture in mind. the only thing i did like was the comparatively light work load. she gives a lot less work than many of the other drawing 1 professors.

Susan is awesome--very kind, and she always finds something positive or interesting to point out in people's work. Expect to spend a good deal of time in the studio, but if you relax and enjoy drawing, then it can be a great third class and stress relieving. Susan really loves the Renaissance masters, and is pretty classical in her approach although she does value creativity, but don't expect to produce anything extract in her class.

this class definitely helped me improve my drawing skills.  Prof Walp was very easy-going and encouraging.
@
Susan Walp
/course/2744
Professor Walp was tough, she was pretty critical at times and didn't give compliments too freely--but I think it was because she saw that we all had potential and didn't want us to get overly confident in our work.  She really knows all about drawing, you can tell by the way she teaches that she understand all that goes behind drawing even something that seems quite simple! The course had weekly assignments, but they were reasonable and could always be done in time, especially because the class was in the afternoon.  Also, even though it was homework, it didn't seem that bad because it was drawing, which is kind of relaxing, so it was something to almost look forward to! I had taken drawing classes in high school, and thought I knew just about everything about drawing, however Professor Walp still had some great techniques to teach that I had not thought of or heard before.  Professor Walp was really nice and understanding, I felt comfortable going up and talking to her if I had a problem with something.  I do think she might have had favorites though, but she did not make it too obvious.  Overall, great class and great teacher--definitely recommend it to anyone!

I had never taken an art class before, and was very apprehensive to take it, but I enjoyed doodling and thought it could break up reading a bit - I was very pleasantly surprised and thoroughly enjoyed the course. It was a lot of time outside of class - mandatory 8 hours a week and often needed more to complete the assignment well, but it didn't feel like work after many reading/writing intensive courses. Not a joke, so you need to be ready to put in the effort and take it seriously. Definately recommend it to anyone interested!! Professor Walp was great!
@
Susan Walp
/course/2744
Overall, this course was okay. My drawing abilities definitely improved over the term (I came in with 0 experience). Professor Walp is pretty good. One major criticism is that she didn't really teach us any techniques in the beginning - I didn't really have any idea how to use charcoal, I had to figure it out on my own. One other complaint I came in not really able to draw at all, and I improved a fair amount. However, I'm only going to get a so-so grade, and as far as I can tell, the good grades seem to be reserved for the people who came into the class as really good artists; Walp doesn't really seem to take improvement that much into account when doing grades (a little aggravating, to say the least). P.S. Just a warning, but you're going to have to draw unattractive naked people, probably old, fat, unattractive naked people
@

The class requires hours of out-of-class studio commitment. The professor is keen on students spending the minimum required hours on each assignments, which is usually between 2-4 hours. However, the professor is very understanding of her students (without being lenient) and is very willing to help.

The rather ineffective teaching style of Prof. Walp added to the complete incompetence of the Studio Art Department on nearly all matters put a damper on what should have been a very interesting and useful class. Most work is so individual that it is possible to learn on your own. Prof. Walp is much better if you have some drawing experience already, don't expect her to give you much guidance that would be helpful to a beginner.
@
Susan Walp
/course/2744
Prof. Walp was great. I've heard so many stories about terribly strict Studio Art profs, so I'm glad I took drawing I with her. She really cared about her students, and tried to teach us as much as she could in the short 10-weeks we had. It was a conventional drawing class overall, and I don't think I learned as much as I wanted to. I didn't progress as much as the other students. She's an easy grader though...I recommend Walp's class to everyone.
@
Susan Walp

I had very little previous drawing instruction, but a general intrest in art.  I didn't think the course was very difficult.  there was the minor thing of attendence, if you missed more than two classes your grade dropped a letter.  this was kind of tough when random afternoon lectures and critiques were scheduled.  walp did provide alternatives to make up for missed classes.
@

I never thought I could draw, but because I'm going into the field of product development, I needed to be able to draw what I was thinking.  I came in with absolutely no experience drawing, but came out confident that I could draw anything with the proper amount of time and materials.  Because of this class, I modified my major with studio art, and I'm taking architecture next term.   EVERYONE should take this class.  And don't be intimidated if you don't think you can draw.  you're honestly not graded on your skill, but instead on the effort you put into the class.
@

/course/2744
Excellent teacher. Did not teach it in a traditional manner - that would've probably been boring. Instead, she tried to relate the a state of mind, a feeling, a philosophy of art. She taught us technique and principles, yes, but she also taught us an appreciation of art and an ability to perceive. She has a very critical and pereceptive eye. She is amazing.

Professor Susan Walp's Drawing I was a really fabulous course.  Every week we had a different subject that taught a different skill.  The course was clearly very carefully planned and the skills we acquired each week were useful in the next week's assignment.  Although the first week was a bit boring (drawing cardboard boxes) the assignments got more interesting quickly (greek sculpture, drapery, still life, hands and feet, bones, each other's faces, nude models...).  We learned to use several different media (pencil, several kinds of charcoal, pen and ink, eraser as a drawing tool).  Watching my work and that of my classmates progress was amazing because we all improved remarkably.  I had thought that drawing was largely a talent you either had at birth or didn't, but this class showed me that drawing can definitely be taught.  This was really a rewarding class.  I came away with several pieces worthy of inclusion in a portfolio and a few pieces worth framing.  The one thing to watch out for is attendance -- if you are one second late you are screwed and Walp will crucify you.    You can't miss any classes and you can't be late.  Attendence is really important, she's crazy about it.

Drawing 1 mixes up your schedule.  It took  time to do the assignments, but it was money not to have MORE reading or writing.  I completely recommend this class, especially with Prof. Walp.  Don't worry about experience, I had never drawn before, and it really is possible to learn.  There will be people that are crazy good in your class, but you don't get graded compared to them, so don't worry about it.  Take it, you can slack or you can work hard, you can see the world in a new way or just use it to try something new.

It was my best drawing class ever! Prof. Walp strongly inspired me and the homework helped me really learn drawing. If people want to take an easy course, it wouldn't be the best subject since the work-load was pretty time-consuming. But I believe it was really productive and I would like to "strongly" recommend drawing 1 for everyone. (Beside, no paper, no exam worked out for me!)
@

/course/2744
I really enjoyed this class. Prof. Walp really actually teaches you how to draw...I learned a lot, and feel much more confident about drawing just about anything. We worked from the model often in class, and our assignments outside of class progressed from simple line drawings to more difficult and involved ones. It does take significant time up outside of class, and if you don't enjoy drawing, this might not be for you. But I found my drawing homework was a nice break from everything else. I highly recommend this class and prof!

This class was phenomenal. I definetly came into the class with low expectations because, well, it's an intro art class that everyone has to take whether they be into photography or sculpture or whatever. And I also heard some horror stories about intro art teachers.  Well Professor Walp was simply great! She was funny and warm from the start. We all took a liking to her immediately.  Although the work was challenging, her comments and suggestions helped immensely and if you listened, you realized that she was right on the ball.  We spent a lot of time critiquing each other's work, which was great because it allowed us to take a step back.  Professor Walp let us do most of the talking, which was really great.  Overall, I loved this class. The assignments were always tough but not too much more than we could really handle...I liked how she walked us through the drawing process step by step so by the end we were all great artists. Bravo!

Alot of people want to take an art class but say, "oh, I don't really have the talent." In this class you can come in with any level of experience and get alot out of it. Everyone's work improved greatly over the course of the term. Be prepared to spend many hours of out of class time in the Hop.

/course/2744
There are two weekly assignments for this class, one due Thursday and one due Tuesday. The mid-week assignment usually takes a few hours, while the weekend one can take upwards of 6-10 hours. This class really is what you put into it. Prof Hamlin is very responsive to all types of styles and art making, and she will push you to do something outside your comfort zone. The only real negative thing I can say is that the class time is mostly spent talking about the homework, not actual drawing. This does change by the end, but in the beginning you'll get tired quickly of standing around talking.
@
Louise Hamlin
/course/2744
There ended up being quite of a bit of homework for this course, but if you do it, you're guaranteed a fair review and Hamlin is very responsive to and appreciative of personal improvement- even if all the course has done is changed the way you feel about art! Definitely the best thing about the course was how much the students interacted outside the class- we really got to know one another and benefited from working on the homework assignments together. Take this course if you want to broaden your horizons, but NOT if you have a heavy course load!!
@

Although the coursework did get repetitive after a while it was effective in teaching the necessary concepts. The assignments do take time, but they are definitely manageable and the HOP is open to art students 24/7 if you like to work at night.

It's a good class if you are willing to experiment with something new. Definitely helps if you had drawing experience before, but most of the class had had no prior experience, and they still turned out some very quality pieces of work. Hamlin's method of teaching drawing changes the way you observe the world to make drawing possible for even the novice.
@
Louise Hamlin
/course/2744
Hamlin was a fun teacher. She has a lot of enthusiasm for art and describing art.  Be warned! Lots of kids come into Drawing I with preset art skills. Hamlin spent way too much time with linear perspectives and trying to get the class away from using "outlines."  Art is a craft and everyone in the class seemed to have improved. This is a fun class and you'll end up with a good grade.  BUT! Know that it TAKE A LOT OF WORK!!! Art may be a fluff class but you still have devote SO much time to it, because when your crappy 1.5 hr drawing is stuck on a wall next to stellar 6 hr masterpiece, for others to critque, you'll be sorry.

You may think that you can take drawing for an easy A, but you're wrong. This class is a lot of work. I spent more time on art projects for this class than I did on assignments for my other classes. Even though I had previous drawing experience, it was a challenge. That said, I did thoroughly enjoy the class. It's nice to have art assignments as opposed to papers or pfojects for other classes. Even though I spent hours in the studio I enjoyed drawing, it stimulates a different part of your mind and helps you unwind. Just be prepared to spend a lot of time at the Hop after hours, but the class is definitely worth it, I enjoyed it very much.

Drawing 1 is a time consuming course, but completely worth every second.  The effort you put into your drawings is not the same kind of work as other courses, so time in the studio is not a burden.  Louise was great. She not only inspired me to think about majoring, but also gave the correct amount of instruction and freedom for everyone in the class to expand their abilities and express their own styles.  We began the course in pencil, drawing simple still lives, and then moved to charcoal.  The last third of the term we could chose which materials to use and had models during class--which I thought was amazing for a beginning drawing class.  Louise has a great sense of what is helpful for students and when. Take this course with her if possible!

The first homework assignment was not my favorite... But this class is quite good.  It requires some time, about 5 hours before each tuesday/thursday class... but the work is fun (if you enjoy drawing), and the class is enjoyable as well.  The environment is very chill, and you get to explore a lot of different subjects and styles.  I highly recommend.
@
Louise Hamlin
/course/2744
First, my enthusiasm for this course stems from my enthusiasm with art in general, and from the fact that Prof. Hamlin gave us the freedom in the assignments to explore and challenge ourselves. The class as a whole was a good learning experience, and I was excited to be able to improve my skills in drawing.  Prof. Hamlin, while often talkative and sometimes hard to reach, gave a lot of productive insight into our artwork.  Another aspect of the course I appreciated was the personal attention received throughout the course.  Prof. Hamlin devoted a lot of time to preparing our classroom and homework assignments, and she also gave a lot of her time to out-of-class discussions of work.  I'm very happy with the course, and am excited to take more studio art classes.
@
Louise Hamlin
/course/2744
The main benefit of this course is just that you're drawing with 15 other students, and Professor Hamlin made this all the better by having all of us tack up each assignment on the wall on the day it was due. I know I greatly improved in drawing through the course. The atmosphere was friendly and relaxed. If you plan to take Drawing I, you should be prepared to spend quite a bit of time on each assignment, but those are hours well-spent.
@
Louise Hamlin

Louise really helps students explore their own styles of art and also exposes them to other ways of drawing.  She teaches students about art in general as well as about the specifics of drawing.  The assignments start off simple and gain in complexity as your skill and comfort increase.

Drawing turned out to be a lot of fun, even for a girl who is artistically challanged.  Hamlin is a good professor, even if she is a little spacey.  Very dedicated, and willing to give you personal help and attention with your work.  Grade very much depends on personal growth and the amount of time you put into it.  A little bit frustrating though when prof. spent a lot of time looking at work of the 2 students who actually knew what they were doing.  Work intensive if you want a good grade - be prepared to live in the Hop.  Overall recommended.
@
Louise Hamlin
/course/2744
It was a good class, but you're going to have to spend tons of time doing drawings in order to get good and/or receive a good grade. If you do everything she tells you, you're going to do both. That also requires anywhere from 10-20 hours a week of work. You'll probably get what you put into this class.
@
Louise Hamlin
/course/2744
Hamlin didnt teach any of the basic skills involved in drawing.  We only went over fundamentals like linear perspective in one class.  Otherwise you are supposed to know everything from the get go.  She says she wont grade you on your ability just effort but she definitely doesnt follow that.  She also plays favorites so if you're in her calss get on her good side.  She assigns a lot of homework and doesnt give you much time to finish your pieces.  Be prepared to spend a lot of time in the drawing studio and if you're there when the janitors come in stay out of their way, they probably work the night shift because they have no social skills and hate dartmouth students.  Hamlin was pretty nice about grades in the end and is open to ideas of course assignments toward the end of the term.
@

Drawing I was even more work than advertised in the ORC, especially as the term progressed and assignments became more difficult.  I found myself spending 12-15 hours outside of class on homework assignments as opposed to 8-10.  The class is well worth it, though; I feel my drawing skills greatly improved from being in the class.
@
Louise Hamlin
/course/2744
I took art classes in high school, but none were as comprehensive and challenging as this class. Students with all levels of ability took the class, and Professor Hamlin encouraged and criticized all equally. Her criticisms were never mean spirited or harsh. I've had considerable experience with studio art before this class, and she pushed me in directions I had never considered, even when I was reluctant about the assignments. Some of the homeworks were boring, but the effort I put in made them worthwhile. Students should be pre-warned --- when the professor suggests 10 hours a week of out-of-class time are necessary, it is not an understatement. I spent at least that amount each week, up to 12 hours on one assignment. But it is possible to fit it in with your other classes. I don't think I will major in studio art, but this class definitely put the idea in my mind. I really enjoyed this class, and highly recommend it to majors and non-majors alike.

this class was awesome.  a lot of people say that drawing 1 is a lot of work.  it is work, but no more than i would have expected and to be honest if you manage your time, it isnt that bad.  it is a nice break from all your other studying and test taking.  hte course is a consistent course. you ahve 5 drawings due every tuesday.  no tricks.  class is just drawing.  the first day IS BORING!! DONT DROP IT AFTER THE FIRST DAY!  Moss is a great prof, and lets the students be as creative as they want.  he leaves options open, get creative, he likes it.  this class is also awesome to take during finals because you have a final crit, which you look at your portfolio and its before finals start so it takes a load off ur finals

I LOVE Ben - as did most of my fellow classmates - but some personalities could definitely not understand or enjoy his pedagogy.  Go to the first class and see if you can survive his lecture, and that'll tell you if you'll enjoy Ben as a professor.  The weekly assignments were not time-consuming, and the perfect way to ease the non-drawers, such as myself, into a natural, un-self-conscious form.  One of my favorite classes at Dartmouth.  Proved completely unintimidating and rewarding for someone nervous to jump into studio art.
@
Benjamin F.
/course/2744
moss is a very unique prof. he rambles on about useless personal stories in the beginning and ends of class, and chooses very odd subjects to draw. we were the only section who didn't get to figure drawing with nude models and moss didn't care for portraits, still lifes, or other normal subjects in a basic drawing class. instead, we drew matchsticks, string, and other random objects. although this could sometimes be interesting, it was often boring and uninspiring. overall though, he is a nice guy and the amount of drawing we did helped me improve a lot  5 drawings per week for the entire term
@
Benjamin F.
/course/2744
I'm not going to lie - I didn't know how much I was going to like the class for the first couple of weeks - The first two lectures are basically a summary of P. Moss's life, and the first assignment (for us) was to draw hangers. I'd never taken an art course before and I did not know what to do... and then, somehow, during the third week or so, something happened. I know it's vague, but his hands off approach to art actually works. trust me. it was kind of an awesome time, and i really learned about myself as an artist
@
Benjamin F.
/course/2744
Although we didn't touch on figure drawing or portraits for some reason the class worked really well with all the random objects we had to draw each week.  You learn a lot just by looking at the art he posts on the wall each day of your fellow classmates and by his few comments.  Just doing a lot of drawing was fantastic and Ben Moss is awesome in appreciating the effort and work you put in..and encouraging you.  It is just a great class to take.
@
Benjamin F.
/course/2744
P. Moss doesn't give lectures.  During class he walks around and talks to students individually about their work.  However, he doesn't meet with all students equally, and there was a three week span when he didn't say a word to me.

prof moss is an interesting person..he starts off the term with a story of how he got into fine arts as a sophomore in college..etc. it's really not too interesting..but it gave me some confidence that maybe it's not too late for me too,  he doesn't really "teach" you how to draw..he lets you do your own thing and loves original stuff..new techniques etc..  the subjects that he proposes aren't the usual conventional still life models..we drew hangars, paper clips, scissors, feathers, shoes, maps, brushes, flowers, animals, and finally fruit. moss is particularly really into abstract art..which i personally had a hard time with, but he is very encouraging, and once he notices you he tries to give you pointers..as for grades, studio art is really subjective so it's all up to him..fairly difficult to get an A..though.

Ben lets you do what you want with the subject that he gives you, the more interesting and different you approach the subject the better he likes it.  He gives you boring subjects in order to get you thinking differently and see how you can make the subject interesting.  He lets you find your own style throughout the course and gives you the freedom to do pretty much what you want with the subject.  Ben seems like a difficult professor at first but is very personable when you talk to him. There isn't too much work, 5 drawings outside of class, but you get the week to do them.  I loved this class and recommend Ben to anyone who is thinking of this drawing course.

drawing - no intelligence required. spend less than an hour a week just sketching a flower or scribbling a hanger, and you'll pull off a great grade. easy and stress-free and moss is super nice. really a genuinely kind guy.  easy way to round out your schedule and takes almost no time at all to do homework etc. just go to class, get your hands dirty with characoal and you'll pass with flying colors.

Ben Moss is a very responsive professor who always has something good to say about your drawings.  He can be funny at times, but he can also be impatient at times.  Sometimes it seems like he thinks the students are just trying to get through the course by doing as little as possible and slacking off, when in reality the students are for the most part pretty enthusiastic about their work.    About the course with Moss in general, it's probably the easiest of the drawing 1 courses.  He won't teach you skills and techniques like realistic shading and how to draw a body, but he'll let you teach yourself if you want.  He gives an assignment of 5 drawings per week on an easy subject, and it's up to us to make it interesting.  There is a lot of freedom to learn what you want.  You will get out of this course what you put in.  Moss likes abstract art, which I didn't like at first, but I liked it more as the class went on.  Although he won't teach techniques, he is very articulate when evaluating and criticising work, and his comments are very helpful.    I really enjoyed this course

I LOVED drawing 1 with moss!! when i took drawing this term, there were 3 classes open with 3 diff teachers.... i picked moss based on his reviews, and i am SO glad that i did.  I thought he was an absolutley amazing teacher.  His teaching style is not overly involved--but for an art class, i think that is REALLY good. he really steps back and lets his students take off in their own, natural direction--and he allows for a lot of different styles to be successful.  he doesnt give lectures on perspective, and we dont do nude models--instead, at the beginning of each class he hands out a "problem" that we are to draw for the period (matches, leaves, etc).  its really quite fascinating, bc as he says, the problem that is handed out really just becomes a vehicle for the drawing itself--the work ceases to be about the object (ie, if everyone were drawing the same still life for perspective, the drawing would be about accuracy).  during class, he walks around and sticks drawings up on the wall that he wants to highlight; at the end of class, he gives a commentary on them, pointing out what he likes. i think we all learned a lot just by being able to see each OTHERS work--and by the end, it was so apparent how much we had all learned.  i remember reading the reviews for him and some people saying that he goes over class--he does, by about 10 minutes. but by the same token, he didnt give anyone a problem who had to go--youd just pack up and leave.  i feel like he might come across as somewhat cold to some people, but if you make the slightest attempt at all to talk to him your efforts are completely reciprocated. plus, he lets us listen to music in class. at the end of his drawing course, i feeel like i have a confidence in my ability--in a large part due to the free structute of the class. and i am not an art major--i am doing econ. soooo id reccomend drawing 1 WITH MOSS to anyone. and on the most basic level, there is no midterm, and a final critique which goes 45 minutes--i wasnt complaining. homework is 5 drawings, due every tuesday--not a huge time commitment (unlike other drawing 1 classes). take it!!!  )

Professor Moss was uncompromising about several issues and demanded a total devotion to the work done in class - which I KNOW grated on more than one student's nerves. For instance, Professor Moss does not allow any talking at ALL between students during classes. For a two-hour session of nothing but drawing, I found myself very, very bored.   The course itself is presented, both in the ORC and by the Professor at the start of the year, as a very informal, introductory course for people INTERESTED in Studio Art. The Professor repeatedly talked about how getting an 'A' in this subject is not important nor hard, as the grade is awarded on the Professor's assessment of improvement and creativity. Given this sort of statement, I thought I did well enough. I attended all classes, as well as regularly complete the homework. But I was given a B at the end of the course - which isn't too low, but I was disappointed. As a student who is not a Stuio Art Major and cares about my GPA, if I knew I'd get a B, I probably would not have taken this subject. This strongly discourages others to 'try out' this subject, for fear or lowering their GPA.   Besides this, I am happy with what I have done in this course and the skills I learnt. Nevertheless, I was left with the feeling that I had achieved all of this myself, and wasn't really helped by the professor much.

If you want to take Drawing I, you probably want to take it with Ben Moss.  First, there are tons and tons of rumors about how Drawing I consumes your life, but if you play your cards right, this doesn't happen with Ben.  He definitely appreciates an extra investment of time, but due to the subjects he chooses for you to draw, you DO NOT need to sell your soul to this course.  Ben is EXTREMELY supportive and takes a special interest in his students.  He makes you want to improve and to succeed.  His teaching style is different from the other prof's, but I think this is beneficial.  We didn't draw for the two first class periods, every period after that was devoted to drawing and critiquing only, there was no final project but there was a final crit, and subjects were very simple feather, brush, string, noodles, paper bag, plastic silverwear, vegetable, clothing, etc.  Other profs start their students on full still life setups the first day, and give lectures on "how to" every period.  Ben lets you discover "how to" and through picking somewhat boring subjects, he forces you to experiment with the medium.  (His idea is that if he picks a boring subject, you will indeed by bored by a traditional rendering and you will get a little crazy, experiment a bit more.  He considers subjects "just an excuse to make you draw.")  Take this course, regardless of the major!

Prof. Moss is a really nice guy but he speaks very softly most of the time.  That is not really a very big problem though because when he speaks to you it is usually one to one.  I expected this class to teach me basic drawing skills, but it doesn't really.  He kind of just lets you go and there is no formal teaching.  That is okay though because you sort of pick it up from the other students who do have experience.  If you want to know the rules of drawing, this class isn't for you, but if you want to just have some motivation to draw something and finish it, then take it.  That is the best thing I got out of it I learned to just draw, to just sit down and draw it because you have to turn in something.   If you have no experience whatsoever it will be intimidating at first, very intimidating and kind of scary, but stick with it if you have always wanted to be able to draw, you might surpise yourself.   and from what I hear the other profs aren't much better, so if you get Prof. Moss consider yourself very lucky.

all the drawing 1 courses do different things. what was great about this course that although i hadn't drawn before, i never felt bad or intimidated. we were allowed to go anywhere with the topic. Moose appreciates the explorations. he always has something interesting to say about your drawings, he's very humorous, encouraging, and fun to work with.  he doesn't give lectures, he lets you draw by yourself, but his critique on the work is very useful and if you ask him, he's always willing to teach you how to do specific things.

Deborah Kahn

She is interesting, but as a professor, doesn't  really explain anything and goes back on what she previous said. It's a little disconcerting to not know how you're doing in the class or what you should be doing. That said, it was still a good class because of the interesting assignments we had.

advice? learn to love your charcoal  Enjoyable drawing class that I didn't find terribly demanding.  Take your time with your assignments and invest some effort in creating them and it'll show.

The term I this course might not be the typical case of drawing one.  Taking this course my sophomore summer, I had Prof. Kahn, who had injured her leg right before the class started.  Therefore the class was much more unorganized than usual.   Kahn believed in no grading of the hw adn class assignments.  Personally I think she was just too lazy to grade the works.  Second she held no office hours so you had really no idea how you were going to do in the class until you get your grade.  Her lectures were really arbitrary and poorly worded, leaving the class often confused of her intentions.    However, her assignments did not take too long, probably b/c she didn't want to come in out of class to grade the hw and graded them all in class.  the only bad thing is that you will probably get an A- no matter how much effort you put into the class (as long as you show up and hand in your hw).  so don't strive too hard for the A since you will probably won't get it. Probably no one person in our class got a bad grade, except Hannah Chase who missed almost every class and blatantly attempted to kiss Kahn's butt on the few days near the end of the term that she decided to come. very funny actually.    Plus Kahn plays favorites so it would be best if you were very eccentric.    easy class for an A- if you want that.

Kahn is awful.  Let me give you an idea what kind of artist she is- she painted the same still life for fifteen years- the SAME UMBRELLA- and now she paints giant blobs with tiny paintbrushes.  She doesn't put any effort into the class- she just shows up.  It may be an easy course, but if you are a major- don't take it with her.  She does not teach you the skills you need to know to go on.  Take Riley- much better prof.

I don't know about the other drawing1 profs, but Kahn is great because you really can be an absolute beginner and you would not feel inadequate or anything.  I have no artistic capabilities whatsoever and the assignments can take up a lot of time but it was fun and was kind of fulfilling.  I even feel a little more 'artsy' now.

I really enjoyed this class. All of the work was drawing, which was fun and allows you to get a break from written work and use a different part of your brain. I've taken many art classes before (but many in my class had not) and this was the best I've ever taken. I really liked Prof. Kawiaka's approach to teaching and she inspired me to challenge myself to become a better artist and explore different techniques. Although we only drew with charcoal all term it never got boring. I would highly recommend this class.

I had a lot of fun in this class and drawing was a nice break  from reading-intensive classes. However, with 7 drawings a week for homework, I spent a lot of time spring term in the studio.

Kawiaka is a little crazy.  She is overly enthusiastic, which is good to keep the students engaged and excited.  The amount of drawings and quality she demaded were way too high.  If you wanted to turn in quality drawing, you wouldn't sleep all term.  She often sounded really positive in her drawing assesments, then gave you a sub par grade.    Kawiaka did an awsome job in improving your skills and her lectures/homework assignments were really good.  I just don't quite understand why she thought my drawings were, "Wow, that is incredible" and i ended up with a B in the class when the median was an A

I felt like this class was really good for those of us who went into it unable to draw and not so good for everyone else. I was no good at drawing before taking the class and I signed up for it so I could take photography courses in the future. Because I had no idea how to draw I was able to just do whatever. I could experiment with things and whether or not they came out perfectly didn't matter as much. Prof. Dalseth is clearly more interested in creativity than realism or accuracy which worked out well for me.  Prof. Dalseth is pretty clear about what he likes and doesn't like, so if you don't take constructive criticism well, avoid this course.  The point is this If you're already a good artist you might want to either take this class with another professor or make sure you're totally open to changing the way you draw. If you don't know how to draw, then this course is for you.
@
Daniel E.
/course/2744
Throughout high school, I took a studio art course each year.  I had a tough teacher then but I still did well, and I thought I was a good artist.  But all of that was shattered when I took this course.  Prof Dalseth is extremely critical and often very sarcastic towards his students in class, which I thought to be very unprofessional.  He won't shy away from embarassing you in front of the entire class either.  Although during critiques, he opens the discussion to the whole class, any time anyone says anything, he will either completely negate what you said or just plain cut you off and say that you're wrong.    He gave readings about how to properly use art terms, but if you do not completely understand the terms, don't bother using them because he will call you out and embarass you.  Also, he tells you to use the readings to help you develop your artistic skills and use what you learn in the readings in your work; but then when you do use them, he'll tell you not to because "there is no formula that you can follow to create good art."  Also, he gave crazy amounts of homework and crazy assignments in general (i.e. go out into the woods at night and do three drawings).  He also wants you to spend LOTS of time on these assignments, so if you have a heavy class schedule, you might want to think twice before taking this class.  If you're interested in learning how to draw better, do not take this class.  He doesn't care if you can draw well or if you have some artistic skill, he is looking more for creativity, which may not be everyone's goal in taking this class.  Yes, he is an accomplished artist and probably knows what he's talking about, but he is definitely not a great teacher and does not know how to communicate what he knows.  He can be very mean, especially if he's in a bad mood, and he has very odd tendencies as well (he's a stereotypical modern "artist").  After taking this class, I will never take another Studio Art class again.

He carried a notebook, but barely ever marked anything down in terms of homework, participation etc.  The grades were all in his head.    In terms of evaluation, the class was like a film cliche; he was hyper critical, almost bringing one student to tears, spouting off things like "this belongs in the recycling bin" in front of the entire class.    He never once drew or taught anything himself, instead relying on photocopying from whatever arbitrary "drawing" books he found and having us read the compiled packets.  I repeat HE DREW ZERO TIMES DURING THE TERM.    During class he played loud, distracting music that made it hard to focus on our drawing.  He had us buy a book for the class and we never once used it or brought it in.  He never graded anything.  When a concerned student asked about their grade he said something like "what does a grade matter? just focus on creating."  The first and only grade we ever got was the final grade we received in the mail after the term had ended.  This may sound severe or bordering on hyperbole, but he was the worst teacher I've ever had.  No other teacher has been less qualified, committed, prepared, or competent.

Professor Dalseth is an interesting guy. He is a little different from most professors, but that is far from a negative comment. He's subtle but very funny. Don't worry about how good you are at art, if you spend time on your work it will show. Get something good to eat and some good music on your iPod and just chill and draw for HW. Even visit the studio after a night out and let the creative juices flow. He loved all my work that was a product of drunken drawing. Just don't tell him.

Chuck Holtzman
/course/2744
Being in Professor Holtzman's class was like taking a stroll through Lewis Carroll's "Alice in Wonderland" novel, in a good way!  His random, yet innovative assignments really force students out of their comfort zones and allow them to explore their artistic talents in a way that defies normal instruction.  In many ways, this class served as a philosophy course.  I must warn, though, that this is not a course for those who are not fond of abstract art, or open to complete exploration and self-discovery.  If you are considering taking Drawing I as your art distributive, though, I strongly recommend that you take it with "Chuck" as he likes to be called!

It was a pretty easy class... because it's not your typical Dartmouth art class - which is usually very time consuming and challenging.   Spurrier is a visiting prof, so he's not an actual prof - meaning his teaching methods are somewhat suspect.  He tells us to "feel" art and understand how to draw, but he tells us that technique doesn't matter.  He never teaches technique. Absolutely no structure.   I would be happy with my grade (considering how little work I did) but I don't think I was even given a chance to display my work with him one-on-one.  I have no idea what he wanted.   Your GPA won't really suffer, but the class doesn't teach you anything.
@

/course/2744
Not terrifically interesting. Don't look for any inspiration in this class - you are not going to find any. I had this class in the morning and as the semester progressed I felt no desire whatsoever to even show up to class - we weren't learning anything. I draw outside of class so I went in hoping to improve or at least learn some drawing techniques going into this class. And I have to say I'm disappointed at the end of the semester. Yeah sure it was fun to work with charcoal - but that's almost ALL you work with. We never used the set of pencils he asked us to buy, or even the ink very much in class...   Before class he asks to see everyone's work so you have to do some work, but I don't think he has very high expectations for the qualities of the work [or can't... since I doubt he's allowed to grade based on the artistic talent of the student.] You do a LOT of still lifes pretty much until the last two or three weeks where nude models start coming into class sessions. If you are uncomfortable with those, you are allowed to ask for alternatives... but I would advise going to these sessions, as ppl are far more interesting to draw than apples, jars, etc.   Pretty much it all depends on how much effort/time/interest you put into this class. This class has a far lighter workload than many of the other art classes. If you are looking for an easy drawing intro in order to get into higher classes, this is the one for you. I'm not sure how he grades exactly... He never explained that during the course, and all of us were too intimidated to ask. That's probably a good thing to ask first day in class.

Ruth Lauer
/course/2744
I got the impression that some people really loved this class. I enjoyed parts of it, but overall it was not what I expected.   I thought drawing 1 meant a bunch of people who have no idea how to draw, having fun and learning how to use drawing materials and the basics of shape, shading, line, space, whatever...and eventually, by the end, being able to produce a technically decent drawing. well, we did not do ANY of that. Professor Lauer did not help us with technique or materials use at all during the entire term. part of that I assume was out of respect for our freedom as artists, but personally I would have appreciated some direction, at least starting out. also she never made any mention of grades, so I still have no idea what kind of grade I'm going to get for this class.   another thing...the other students in the class came into drawing 1 already being extremely talented artists. I was not expecting that. we always had to hang up the assignments we did for homework and I would be downright ashamed. also I felt like Prof. Lauer would look at my drawings and assume that since they were pretty bad, I must not have spent very much time on them, but I always did! her weekend assignments were rough...3 drawings in a weekend. it doesn't sound like much, but I definitely underestimated how much work a studio art class could be.   then once we hung up our drawings the professor would talk to each of us about what we did. she had constructive criticism to offer, but it was more about the feeling of the drawing, not the technique or how you could improve. there was a point in the middle of the term when it felt like we were all trying to please her. and since the standards of "good" and "bad" are so arbitrary in art, this was very frustrating.   in the end I found that I was able to draw much better than when I started out...but everything I learned was by trial and error, not from the class itself. so basically you're paying for a term of drawing 1, but all you're getting is drawing materials and the obligation to draw for ~15 hours/wk. but whatever, it's over, I got my ART distrib, I'm happy.

Don't take this class expecting it to be easy. I ended up putting the most time and effort into this class because art is never done. There is always something that can make it better, but it becomes time consuming. However, I enjoyed this class a lot. Everything was taught by example and by direct comments about your specific work. My drawing definitely improved a lot over the course.

Garand is a tough one...she started out easy going, then midterm she really began to crack the whip.  I'm glad she did; her philosophy surrounding how to draw was an interesting one and allowed me to gain appreciation for the media that I worked with and the 2D form.  She has no hesitations on calling you out on some aspect of a drawing she knows was due to lack of time or effort, and knows exactly what every student needs to improve upon in terms of basic skill and conceptual risk-taking.  Take this class if you are good at being critical of your own work and don't mind others looking and critiquing what you do.  If you put in the time, the amount that you know will surprise you at the end.

I liked this class I think it was a nice balance between relaxed and challenging. it was nice. i thought she organized the class well and I thought that her criticism was helpful most of the time.  the only thing that I had a major problem with was the fact that she kept telling people to go slowly, draw slowly and I think that made me a worse artist because at the end of the day I am just naturally a faster artist and therefore, I am able to portray things on paper better when I draw at a faster pace. But other than that I thought she was very naturing to anyone who didn't really know how to draw.  This class however, in spite of it's misleading "drawing 1" name, has absolutely no one who cannot draw, but it is fun!

I really enjoyed this class. It wasn't too much work, and the assignments and drawings we did in class were fun. Professor Bowen really tried to mix things up, and it worked well; we went on a few field trips to draw or look at drawings and that was interesting.   Drawing I is known to be a really time-consuming class, but we only had assignments every Thursday due Tuesday, and we didn't even have a final project. Professor Bowen gave us a lot of freedom in our assignments, so we all came up with very different approaches.   The individual critiques at midterms and at the end of the term were very informative to. Overall, a fun class.
@
Paul Bowen
/course/2744
I am an ENGS major with pre-med, so I guess I am used to classes that require a lot of work.  But really, this class was the best third class ever because it required very little work but was still extremely interesting and worthwhile.  Prof. Bowen was a temporary professor and I hope they hire him again, because he is very enthusiastic about art and his students.  He did not assign us ANY homework between Tuesdays and Thursdays, which was awesome.  Between Thursdays and Tuesdays, he would give us an assignment, which would be a topic such as "Light and Dark" or "Paper Bag."  These would be very open-ended, so it was always interesting to see what people came up with.  I had a little bit of trouble figuring out what he liked at first, but I eventually figured it out, and had a great time.  During one week, I spent a total of 45 minutes on the homework because I had been busy with my other classes, and that was totally OK.  In the final week, I stepped up my drawing to 10 hours in that week, but we had no final project, so it was really nice to not have to spend 24 hours on a final project.  I had never taken an art class before, although I have always drawn on my own.  If you are worried about your level of drawing talent, be assured that Prof. Bowen is less interested in your drawing talent that your artistic vision--i.e., how you place objects in the picture, and so forth.  You don't need to be able to make a photorealistic drawing of a crumpled piece of paper or an acorn, as I have heard is required in other classes.

Drawing can take up all of your time but Ferrara was good about not overloading us with work.  He is pretty spacey and likes art to be an expression of your feelings, an outlet -- his main objective is to get you to see art that way.  He doesn't really care whether you are good at it or not.  He's much more relaxed then the other profs and much less work.  He gave little direction but had us study line, still life, creative composition, and figures.  I actually really liked the class and I was pretty bad at it.

i never took a drawing class before but it really doesn't matter. prof will grade you on your effort, participation, and improvement. the only difficult part is that it's pretty time consuming. if you like drawing then you'll really like this class. i had so much fun i'm definitely going to take another studio art class.

DO NOT TAKE THIS WITH SUNNY PARK. Gerry is utterly amazing, he actually teaches you to look at the world differently. You have to show you're trying, but honestly if you don't you're wasting an amazing opportunity. Best art professor I've ever had. Generally two to four hours of work between each class, but occasionally you'll get the time off. No x-hours. Had a different class with Sunny, and it's really not worth taking classes with her.

Overall this class was less work than most of the other reviews claimed it to be.  Professor Levant gave us a drawing per week, taking 2.5 hours per week for the first two weeks.  For week 3 and 4 we had basically no HW.  After that the work picked up, reaching 10-15 hours in the last two weeks.  I would not recommend taking this class unless you are a fairly good drawer or are willing to work your ass off.  Their are only two ways to get a high grade in this class artistic talent or extreme effort.  If you're talented then (at least our) Professor will like your drawings and you won't have to work too hard.  If you're not talented but you put in an extreme amount of effort -- show up to all x-hours, office hours, and work after every lecture and do 15+ hours drawing per week, you can get a high grade without excellent drawings.  Maybe there is a middle ground - I don't know my grade yet )

AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!! By the time of finals, every student in the class had grown SO much as an artist. Professor Cholnoky really pushes students to discover their own style and is always encouraging and helpful. Warmups were fun, assignments all had a personal element that allowed you to create art that you were excited to create, and feedback was INCREDIBLE. Couldn't recommend a better or more intelligent prof

I'm glad that I took the class because it wasn't a typical class (where I had to take tests or write papers) and because I really like to draw.  It was a lot of work, though, (I often spent hours in the drawing studio) and I don't feel like I improved very much.

Prof Wilson assigned an understandable amount of work that wasn't difficult to complete on time. Earning an A is super easy, just draw a TON in your sketchbook and do extra drawings outside of class for extra credit.

Park has a fantastic ability to really connect with her students-I felt that she was really invested in our success, and that she truly wanted us to become better artists. I know I did-my only previous drawing experience before this class was a class in second grade on how to draw a turtle-so at the beginning of this class, I could draw fantastic turtles, but not too much else. Now I really feel that I can express what my words can not through a visual medium-and any visual medium, too. People who want to take photography or architecture might look at this class and think "This doesn't make sense! The whole reason I take photographs/use a computer design program is to avoid drawing!" But it's really infinitely helped my creativity-she encourages you to think outside the boxes of convention, and even outside the dimensions of the paper if she's on her game. Also, no matter how talented you are to start with, she can always find something to criticize about you work to help you improve even further. If one thing was changed about this though, I wish that she put a little less emphasis on abstract art, which is what she does(sculpture) and a little more on the technical aspects of drawing. Also, she's a little scatterbrained. Part of being the crazy artist, I guess! She is not easy in any way, shape or form-she told us at the beginning of the term that she assesses our progress against all of the students she has ever taught, and that "A C is average". Scary! But you'll do fine. Take this!

I don't know if these other reviewers were on crack while writing their reviews or if they've never had a good prof, because this was one of the worst classes I've ever taken, and I'm currently in it. Like the reviewer right before me, I've contemplated taking the W for this class instead of having to sit through this bull three times a week. Her problem sets will literally take hours, as they are the most tedious, annoying assignments you'll ever have. If you have a life then I'd recommend not taking this class because it is an absolute waste of my time. Lectures put me to bed, and that's made worse by the fact that I know I'll have to go back to my dorm and crank out fifteen pages of her ridiculous psets. Her chants barely help (if you need a chant to remember that GDP is C+I+G+NX, I have no clue why you're at Dartmouth). Rose is a really nice person but she's just not a good professor by any means. I learn more through the textbook than I do her class. If you want to have a decent econ22 experience, take literally any other professor. If you choose to ignore this review, sure, take the class, but I GUARANTEE you'll be ripping your hair out by the eighth hour working on your first problem set (not exaggerating). Rip

Absolutely horrible prof. Hated going to her classes. She makes you sing stupid songs in the middle of her class. You will end up feeling like a kindergartener learning ABCs for the first time. Honestly, she teaches you nothing. In class, all you do is copy her notes down. No explanation or discussion is provided in her classes. She also randomly makes insults towards students. Of course, she might consider them her own little "joke", but insulting varsity players to "try harder" when she absolutely does not care about them is not a simple joke from my perspective. You have to teach yourself struggling to do the problem sets. Those who like her classes are those who just like singing and dancing in general. If you hate singing and dancing to stupid chants, pro tip don't take her class. I consider myself as an Econ major but thought about getting a W rather than having to cope with her class for 3 more weeks.

Amazing professor. More work than the other professors, but definitely worth it. She makes learning the material so easy. Her tests are extremely straight forward and based on the work done in class. She makes up cute little songs you wouldn't think would help but they stick with you and she's so helpful! If you take this class, take it with her!

Professor Rose was one of my favorite Profs at Dartmouth. She was incredibly engaging throughout lectures and would break for productivity moments each class so that we could refocus. She would come up with unique chants to help us remember crucial formulas, and although they were a little weird at first, they actually helped! Workload More work than most other profs, but it's worth it. There are readings for each topic that you have to do, but they aren't that long. If you pay attention in class, you don't really need to read the textbook. She gives students all the past midterms to study from, so the exams are pretty straight forward. About 80% of your grade is exams (2 midterms and a final).

Course The course was very interesting and useful. We learned about relevant things--monetary policy, inflation and so on. Fair amount of work though.  Professor Rose is an engaging lecturer, she keeps you paying attention. She's helpful out of class, fair grader.  Workload It was a pretty decent workload. Had to read a bunch of articles outside of class, two midterms, 6 problem sets and a final. Everything was graded fairly. Overall, decent amount of work but interesting and worth it.
@
Marjorie Rose
/course/865
Professor Rose is a very good professor, and the class is really straightforward. 4 Problem sets roughly 10% of the grade. Midterms/Final was 75% of the grade, those were also straightforward and easy to prepare for if you pay attention in class and do all of the readings.
@
Marjorie Rose
/course/865
You will appreciate this class.   So, here is the rundown. Yes, there are chants during many lectures.  Yes, this class is extraordinarily easy.  However, lectures are jumbled and the professor often fails to hand out her class lecture syllabus for a unit until after the set of lectures, which makes following along very difficult.  After studying for the final, I am a bit curious where all the time was spent in this class.  Honestly, I think anyone could learn a chapter of the book in about 15 minutes (and the class covers 12 chapters).  Often, we did exercises that were subjective and incorrect in class, which didn't really help my learning.  Honestly, I think this is the first class I've had at Dartmouth where I could have done better by not going to class, as I would have had a clearer perspective on the topic.   Now, my major gripe with this class is the tests.  They are too easy.  You just have to rewrite VERBATIM what you have learned in class.  I mention verbatim because she is a teacher that looks for buzz words like "credit crunch" or "devaulation", and if you can mention these you will get median on the tests.  To get an A, one must do the readings (there are about 3-5 per test and compromise about 40% of the test grade) and be able to remember the article very well, so you can answer questions about small points discussed in the article.    Other than that, if you have a great memory for articles and can sit through her lectures and be able to gather her "buzz words", I would recommend this class.  Otherwise, steer clear!

Overall I made it out of this class ok, but the teaching style was difficult and I often felt like it did not connect the dots.

You should definitely take Econ 22 with professor Rose if you can. I'm not sure what else you could ask for out of an Econ class - she teaches with enthusiasm, she's extremely approachable and creates a familiar classroom atmosphere, she explains concepts clearly, the class moves at a very doable pace, the problem sets are very straightforward, and the tests are completely accurate representations of what is taught in class. Simply put, loosely read each chapter before it's discussed in class, go to class, re-read anything you still aren't clear about, go to office hours for any questions about the problem sets, and it will be very hard not to do well in this class.

Prof Rose is really great, she's easy to talk to, and a very good lecturer. Sometimes it reminded me of high school becuase there was class entertainment every day and we sang songs to learn formula's, which was a bit childish and annoying. But overall she's very good at teaching macro and getting key concept drilled into your head.   3 problem sets that were extremely straight forward and easy, did them all the night before in about 2 hours each.  2 midterms that were pretty tough and had a wide distribution, 60-70% was a B-  Final was tough but do-able. She grades fairly as well and gives points on tests for showing some effort.
@
Marjorie Rose
/course/865
Prof. Rose is an effective lecturer.  She follows the book for the most part, but also throws in some articles that turn out to be extremely important on the tests.  She usually gives ~20% of the test on these readings.  The course is very simple, though.  2 midterms and a final.  The tests are a bit annoying because the multiple choice questions are worth 5% each, but in general they are very easy.    Take only if you have to because the material is dry.  As far as a major track, this class should not scare you.  It is, by reputation and actuality, the easiest econ necessity.

Econ 22 with Rose is a great course.  The material is interesting, the work is not too intense, and the exams are all extremely fair.  She doesn't use powerpoints during lectures, so taking thorough notes is definitely crucial.  I more or less copied and studied everything she wrote on the board and found that the exams weren't too hard.  It is true that she sometimes finds herself pressed for time, having to rush a bit at the end of her lectures, but any topic left unclear can be supplemented by the textbook.  Overall, Rose is an awesome and fun teacher and Econ 22, at least with Rose, is an interesting course.

CHANTS CHANTS CHANTS  That's what we did in this class to help us memorize different macroeconomic concepts, and to be honest, they didn't help, but the idea does reflect the peculiarity of Professor Rose. She grows on you very much. Personally, I thought she was great. Her lectures were very lucid. Her tests were not difficult, and she tried to keep the class interested. She does have entertainment time during class, which every student is responsible for. I thought it was great.   How to do well in this course Write down everything she writes on the board! This is essential, especially when she does comparative statics on the board. When test-time comes around, memorize your notes.  Now, the textbook. If you have time, read it. If you don't, then it's not as big as a deal, but I do recommend you do. There are a few multiple choice questions on tests, but again notes are way more important.

Before taking Econ22, all I heard was that I needed to take it with Feyrer, how he's awesome and "the man."     I'm telling you now--take this course with Rose.  She's so enthusiastic about the material, making us do chants and hand motions...the enthusiasm really is contagious.  I never picked up the WSJ until now, and I can actually understand a lot more than before.  She's not a bad lecturer.  She's just not good with time management.  65 minutes go by REALLY fast in her class, and that's probably a first at Dartmouth!  The great thing is she follows the textbook like bible, so if you miss something or don't follow, the book clears up everything.    Tests so straightforward, and SO fair.  I've taken Econ1 and Econ10 and they were EXTREMELY frustrating, because the tests were ballcurves...and no matter how much effort I put, I never did well.    Rose's exams almost remind me of high school tests--you put in the effort, you get a good grade.  Yes she sortof takes points off for every little thing...but those points are REALLY itty bitty.  Like -1 or -2 (max) for graphs which are worth 30 points for example.  So she's REALLY lenient.  I really have no complaint. She owns Feyrer.  TAKE THIS WITH HER.

The tests were easy, but she took off points for the smallest things. The problem sets aren't graded. Readings aren't necessary. Just pay attention in class. There is class entertainment. Everyone has to tell a joke or entertain the class in some way. It's weird, but you get used to it. And she made us learn chants.

Econ 22, along with Econ 26, are one of those courses where you've actually feel like you've learned something useful by the time the course is over. You basically learn about how the economy functions on a macro scale (hence the name) -- things like GDP, inflation, fiscal & monetary policy, etc. Rose is an extremely nice person and caring professor; she constantly asked people during class about where they were from, what they did on campus, what they were interested in, etc. Also, everybody was assigned one day where they had to provide "class entertainment" midway through the lecture -- like a joke or a YouTube video or something like that.  However, she was a pretty poor lecturer, in my opinion. She didn't use PowerPoint; instead, she wrote everything on the board, but often times, she would go so incredibly fast that I felt myself simply trying to race to copy everything off the board without actually understanding what was going on, and this was especially the case towards the end of the lecture when she would run out of time (often because of drawn out class entertainment) and would fly through major topics in less than 5 minutes. I often found myself sitting and actually learning the material for the first time with the textbook the night before exams because it made no sense up until that point -- it definitely made for some stressful periods studying the nights before the midterms and final.  Overall, she's a very nice person, but a pretty poor lecturer -- if you end up in one of her Macro sections, it's not necessarily a bad thing...just be prepared to spend a lot of time relearning the material on your own because you won't necessarily comprehend it during lecture.

Professor Rose sets a good pace for the class and explains everything many times so that it's very clear.  The entertainment in the middle of the class is a good way for students to relax before the lecture continues.  She doesn't use powerpoint so students aren't put to sleep.  Instead, she writes everything you need to know on the board so just copy the notes and you'll have everything you need to know before the exam.  Her tests are very fair and are a good representation of what she taught in class.

As always, econ classes will absolutely screw you if you get behind.  This assessment is totally applicable here.  Prof. Rose is a very good lecturer, but it is imperative that you do the reading and/or go over your class notes on a regular basis to actually learn the material.  Two midterms and a final don't leave much room to do poorly early on in the term.  Otherwise, I feel like Prof. Rose is pretty responsive and really tries to engage her students in the class discussion.  You'll fall asleep if you sit in the back, though.  The material is interesting if you actually take the time to learn it.

It's not easy. Really. But at least Professor Rose is a good professor. She's certainly more interesting than most of the other professors in the Economics Department and she can hold her own against the better professors at the college. She can go fast sometimes, but the joke everyday in the middle of class helps lighten things a bit. The midterms and finals can be difficult, but if you keep up (which is difficult), then you should be fine.  If you're an Economics major, look no further for Econ 22 professors. There are no easy professors, but there are good professors. And Professor Rose is a good professor.

If you are interested in macroeconomics, don't even bother reading this - you'll like the course, and you'll love Prof. Rose. She's an incredibly knowledgable person and an effective lecturer who is very good at maintaining neutrality in a somewhat normative field.  On the other hand, however, macroeconomics can be an incredibly dry and tough subject for someone who's more interested in business and microeconomics and is only taking this course to satisfy the ECON major. Since this is a somewhat mid-level course, I would assume that people who are not interested in economics wouldn't even be considering it, so I won't try to persuade/dissaude them in any way.  My advice for this course just grin and bear it. It's a requirement for the major, so just try and chug through whether you think it's boring or not.

For me, this class was pretty hard.  On a day to day basis, it was easy to get by.  But when exams came around, I felt like I was screwed (as did many of those around me).

Although this is a pretty tough class, it is one of the most interesting econ classes you can take as well. Professor Rose is very knowledgeable and responsive in class, tries to make the class fun with the daily joke and inspires interest for macroeconomics. I personally took this class with two other hard classes, thinking that this would not be that demanding. Well, I was wrong. You do have to read the textbook/notes and some assigned articles periodically. The second midterm and the final are also pretty hard, but overall, I recommend taking the class and taking the time to actually understand all the principles.
@
Marjorie Rose
/course/865
Professor Rose tries really hard to be engaging and tries to make the material more "alive" by handing out articles that pertain to what we are learning in class. The one thing that bothered me was how she rushed at the very end of class to fit everything... honestly if she just spent 5 more minutes explaining everything, I think the whole class would have been in a better position. But besides that, she's definitely one of the better professors in the economics department.   A word of advice is to read the handouts and case studies! Tests are not memorize this and choke up the answer, but instead you really have to remember what the article said and use the appropriate models we learned in class and apply them to the question.   Other than that, if you go to class and read everything you are supposed to do, you will do fine.

Professor Rose was awesome!  She is the first econ professor that I've had who did not read off of PowerPoint slides.  She actually TAUGHT the material!  Not only that, but she made macroeconomics interesting and applicable.    That being said, of the econ classes I've taken thus far, this is the first one that actually required studying/concentration.  On top of covering an entire textbook worth of material in a few short weeks, Rose hands out multiple articles that you need to know/understand VERY WELL in order to do well on her exams.  Exams were tough and very thorough.  But keep up with the reading, go to class, do the problem sets/practice exams, and you'll be fine.  In the end, you'll walk away from the class having actually learned something!

while basic macro isn't the most exciting subject in the world, prof. rose does a good job of creating a relaxed class atmosphere that makes the tedious parts of the material easier to handle.  rose is definitely the most personable econ prof i've had.  the course can move a little slowly (esp at the start), but it's actually nice to have a class that doesn't feel like it's racing through material at breakneck speed.

The material of the class itself is not too bad. Sitting through a Rose lecture of the material, however, is miserable. Most of the models can be learned pretty well out of the book. If you keep up on the reading you will do well in the class. Rose's lectures will not help, though.

@
Marjorie Rose
/course/865
The material you learn in this class is quite useful and has some interesting applications to the real world, but learning it is extremely boring. Prof. Rose makes this problem much worse. Her lectures are straight out of the textbook. Her knowledge of the material extends no further than the textbook. If a student asked her to elaborate on a concept, she was often unable to or distorted the student's question into something she could BS her way through. Someone who had read the textbook in advance could teach this class as well as Rose.  The tests were reasonably fair, but Rose's grading was somewhat capricious. She always emphasized that she would give partial credit for showing your work even in incorrect answers, but in practice, she almost never gave any partial credit. Small math errors could cost you a lot of points on her tests. Aside from her poor grading, the tests themselves were a reasonably fair assessment of the material. Everything on the tests was directly from the textbook. This combined with the fact that Rose's lectures were straight out of the textbook meant there was no reason to go to class. She knew this and thus introduced pop quizzes to force people to go to class. The sole reason to go to class was the threat of the pop quiz.  Avoid Rose if you can. Take Econ 22 with Feyrer. I have heard he actually made the material tolerable.

The course was interesting and the topics are applicable to the economy today.  Rose did a good job covering textbook material and answering student's questions.  She also made the class interesting by including jokes.  If you catch up with the reading and understand the material, then you should have no problem.  THe textbook is really important too because she basically just goes over the material from the chapters.

Rose lectures straight from the book, and expects you to go to class.  While she does break up class well with a joke, she doesn't stray too far from the text, and you don't really need to go to class (except to hopefully avoid the pop quiz she threatens and used once during the term).  Overall it's pretty good and if you need to take macro I'd recommend Rose.

This is just a very typical Econ class with not much homework. The exams are not hard so you might end up with a median grade since everyone tends to do well.

And if you could come up with a good joke, she might like you more.

The class was an 11 and most of the time I couldn't even pull myself out of bed to go.  It was just SOOO BORING.  She's such an awful lecturer, and there are always those 2-3 kids who ask a hundred 'intelligent' questions each class, and it was just so not worth it.  She lectures pretty much straight out of the books and the other readings, except for about the last two weeks of class when she jumps around so you should attend class (or at least get the notes from someone.)  Overall, though, from the classes I did attend and what I learned from the readings (I ended up doing just fine in the class), I think this was a pretty solid overview of macroeconomics.  She's boring, but she hits all of the relevant topics and does some to apply theory to actual cases in history or current events.  At least I did leave the class feeling like I actually learned something - which is saying a lot, considering I went to class probably only half the time.

Prof. Rose is very enthusiastic and the material is interesting. Her stated goal is for the students to be able to read The Economist after the course and understand the underlying macro-economics. She succeeds.

This is definitely one of the easier courses in the econ series. The material is good, readings are helpful and short, the problem sets are optional (save them to study with), and the exams aren't overly difficult.  The downside is that Marjorie Rose is a sometimes incomprehensible prof.  It's not that she has an accent or talks quickly, it's just that she doesnt have that all-important ability to make things clear.  Exams were mostly fair but occasionally had an obscure question from in-class handouts. This course is survivable even for non-majors. Recommended.

Econ is a rather dry subject but professor rose found a way to make 22 as painless as possible. if you need/want to take 22 i would strongly suggest taking it with rose.

Rose is by far the best prof I've had at Dartmouth she's organized, interesting, and even funny at times.  Lectures on economic theories and graphs could have become tedious, but prof. Rose's energy kept the class engaged.  The book is also fantastic, and Rose (appropriately) follows it pretty closely.  Tests are multiple choice and short essay/graph drawing, and are of moderate difficulty.  Nothing on the test is unexpected; some of the problems, however, can get a little tough.  There is a significant scale, so if you study the material, you will do fine.  For econ majors, this is a required course, and Rose is the way to go.  For non-econ majors, I definitely recommend this course if you'd like to understand the economics behind policy decisions... it makes every economic issue you read about in the newspaper a little easier to follow.

I am one of those people who finds economics interesting. This class consisted of very interesting material. After taking it, I can say that I understand much more of what is going on in the business world.  However, I cannot relate this to Prof. Rose's teaching ability. I really think she has very little of it. Prof. Rose is a very intelligent and accomplished Economist. She has worked for the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, in addition to having done research in many countries. Unfortunately, she decides to base her lectures right from the textbook. This makes going to class relatively useless. Lectures are uninspring. She quickly draws graphs, writes up unintelligible notes on the board, and then quickly erases them and moves on to new material. She also seems unable to clearly answer the most basic questions students ask her in class and during office hours.   Luckily, the textbook is one that is very good. It explains concepts and details very clearly. Another method that helped me was to find a copy of the solutions manual that had the answers to the questions at the end of each chapter, with explanations. This helped me immensely.   And no I am not sore. I did quite well in this class. If you have Rose, be sure to read the book and do the questions at the end of each chapter.

Professor Rose is a really great professor in class. She is extremely responsive to students and is eager for class participation. Unfortunately, she can become very confusing in her lecture and the book definately helps during these times. The grade is only based on 3 hard exams so make sure you really understand the material. Definiately take it with Rose though..

Do you read the Economist or the Wallstreet Journal, then take this course.  If you don't, then you probably should take this course because it provides essential knowledge for understanding America and the world.

Do not take this course from Rose, she is a terrible professor and an embarassment to the Econ department.  This course is offered a number of times with a number of different professors, so there is no reason to punish yourself with the worst lectures ever when the material could have been done well.  I cannot stress this enough DO NOT TAKE FROM ROSE, SHE IS A HORRIBLE PROFESSOR.
@
Marjorie Rose
/course/865
She didn't seem to know what she was talking about. If you asked her to give a different example then what was in the book she wasn't ever able to do so and often time she was unable to answer simple questions. The exams thought they were curved I didn't think they were a fair evaulation of the material.

This was the first econ class that I have taken that the material was actually applicable to what goes on in the world....teacher just repeated the book in class so either class or reading will do fine
@
Marjorie Rose
/course/865
Econ 22 with prof. Rose was one of the best classes I've taken at Dartmouth so far. At the time I enrolled in the class I was still deciding if I wanted to be an Econ major and this class definately convinced me that Econ can be interesting, fun, and applicable. Professor Rose was always well-prepared and gave concise, effective lectures. She made an effort to know each student by name and even rememberd facts about people, asked the athletes about recent games, etc. There were really no out of class assignments--all that was necessary was to do the book reading in time for the tests. The tests were a pretty fair representation of the course material and Prof. Rose was relatively generous in grading them. The text was very clear and re-inforced what was covered in lectures rather than introducing new material. Overall, I feel that this class is a good one to take for anyone interested in majoring in econ or with an interest in how economics can be applied to real world phenomena.

I just want to say first that my grade was fine.  Macro is a very boring subject, and it was compounded by the lack of knowledge and teaching skills of the professor.  She needs to assign homework and do something other than copy the book on the board. She wrote tests that were almost completely irrelevant to the material (i.e. a 40 was a C- on the second midterm) and had trouble answering almost any question (or at least could not find a way to explain answers so that students can understand). The most important exam questions were on obscure appendices and handouts she didn't teach, and the relevant material that was taught had little weight on the exams.  If you are considering taking this course, I suggest you wait until another prof is teaching it.
@
Marjorie Rose
/course/865
If you want to know how the country works or know what you are reading about in the paper, take this course.  It is a great presentation of Macroeconomics.    I would rate Prof Rose as one of the top profs I've had at Dartmouth. She doesn't mess around with powerpoint. She puts everything on the board.  She knows the students well and is very interesting.  You really should go to class every day.  Exams were tough, but fair. 2 midterms, cumulative final.

Overall this was a pretty good course. The prof's office hours were limited and usually early in the morning so that kinda sucked but am sure u could make an appointment outside her scheduled times if u needed. The textbook is very well written and easy to understand. Would definitely recommend that u use the workbook for practice problems. She's not a fan of giving sample exams out so u have to find ur own means of practicing on questions. Liked this course a lot more than microecon because u were getting more of a big picture view and she made an effort to give us articles that illustrated how what we were learning related to the real world and current affairs.
@
Marjorie Rose
/course/865
Macro might be the worst part of being an Econ major.  It's not hard at all.  It's just really boring.  Then, to toss some salt into the wound, the Professor was confused a lot.  She didn't seem to know much of the material outside of what she was reading out of the book during the lectures.  She's got a good resume, but she needs some polishing up on her teaching skills.

Feyrer gives interesting lectures. He is engaging and easy to follow. The class doesn't require a lot of work. There are homework assignment due once a week and can sometimes take a long time to do, but overall the workload is pretty light. The only things that you are graded on in this class are homework (for completion), two midterms, and the final - so the assessments are worth soooo much of your grade and they're also very hard. So this class isn't that much work, but you need to study really hard to do well and it's easy to get a bad grade. Very interesting class though. It's a prereq so when you take it do it with Feyrer.

Course It's Macro Econ, people told me it's the most boring but the easiest of econ courses. imo, it's NOT boring and it is easier than econ 20 (ofc). It's a lot of concepts and you have to memorize those concepts... like any other class. it's a manageable course. Medium difficulty   Professor I really like Feyrer ) His lectures are really fast/confusing in class so I just run through my notes/book in my dorm.  He grades fairly.  He's helpful during office hours (has a lot of them). Well, he tries to be helpful. Sometimes I still didn't understand the material.  His tests were not too bad. They were in class, 1 hour. He said his final should take only about 1.5 hours.   Workload It's a medium-difficult course.  His problem assignments were doable. They did not suck up your time.  Study for his tests!! that's 90% of your grade )  He's a good professor, always has a happy attitude with his coffee mug

Course I did not care for this class. I didn't find it very interesting at all, but maybe that's just me. I discovered while taking this course that I am not an econ person. I just found the models we studied to be illogical and far-fetched (and usually inaccurate).   Professor Prof. Feyrer is very passionate about his subject. However, he isn't very good at explaining concepts to people (like me) who don't automatically understand the material. His lectures also move super fast. If you blink, you might miss a slide of his powerpoint. (Fortunately, he posts his ppt on Canvas, which was great because I found the book to be no help.) I feel like he didn't put very much time into writing his exams; in my opinion, the wording of questions was often unclear. He is also not generous with partial credit on exams.  Workload 6 problem sets. Technically there was textbook reading, but I didn't do it because I thought the book was not very useful (I read, like, the first 5 chapters); instead, I read over Prof. Feyrer's powerpoints, which were pretty self-explanatory. 2 non-cumulative midterms and a final on all the material from the term. Although I found this class hard and unenjoyable, I did not think that the workload was unreasonable.
@

Course Solid course, good material. Basic econ course with your graphs and basic equations - pretty light as far as depth goes. midterms very straightforward, and if you study you will do well.  Professor Awesome prof! I really loved feyrer. I thought he was an interesting and organized lecturer that always brought it back to real life. he was also really helpful. DEFINITELY take this with feyrer.  Workload One pset a week and you could skip 1 or 2 depending on how many you did; they were graded based on whether you finished and not how you did, which was awesome. I read the book occasionally, studied heavily from notes/powerpoint slides that he provides, and he gives you TONS of old midterms and finals to study from.

Course Went over big concepts in macroeconomics.  Its a major course, so you're probably going to take it because of that.   Professor Professor was knowledgeable, and pretty fair.

Feyrer teaches well, gives fair exams. There's nothing to complain about except the hour (9L). Problem sets are generally ungraded (they technically are, but you get credit as long as you turn them in). Exams are ok. I didn't think I'd enjoy macro, but I really did with Feyrer.

Feyrer is a nice guy, no doubt about it, and his lectures are definitely effective and interesting. However, he is quite possibly the laziest professor I have ever seen in my academic career. He takes days to respond to blitzes, is rarely available outside of class, and displays a generally careless attitude toward his students.   He constantly reuses problems from his old exams, so as long as you memorize the answers to the ones he provides you, you should be fine.

If you have to take macro, definitely take it with feyrer. He is VERY animated in class which makes it so easy to pay attention to lectures.  The material is fine, nothing complicated, but nothing captivating either - its your average intro econ class. The psets aren't difficult, but also don't prep you much for the exams which is annoying. He does a lot of true/false on exams that end up counting a lot... also annoying.
@
James Feyrer
/course/865
Prof. Feyrer is a really nice guy and solid prof.  His lectures are organized, the textbook is actually readable, and he's helpful at office hours.  Macroeconomics is still macroeconomics, which means that for some people its hard and dry and others its interesting and easy.  If you want to take macro though, I'd recommend his class to you.  Exams are difficult, but its curved so its actually better that they're difficult.
@
James Feyrer
/course/865
Prof. Feyrer is a lively and energetic lecturer, and he ties many of the macroeconomic concepts we learn to current events.  His lectures are pretty straightforward and he uses examples/graphs that more or less come from the textbook.  The lectures actually involved more math (some calculus derivations) than I expected, but we weren't really tested on them.  My recommendation Study for the exams from the past midterms that Feyrer posts on Blackboard; this is sure to improve your grade.
@
James Feyrer
/course/865
Where to begin? This class taught me so much about the basics of macroeconomics and was extremely enlightening.  The pace of the class is just about right and Professor Feyrer structures it so that the first part of the course is focused on the long-run economy and the second part on the short-run economy.  He always connected the material in his lectures to world financial history and he occasionally brought up the current economic crisis.   We also had the pleasure of attending a lecture by Danny Blanchflower about his work on the British Monetary Policy Committee.  Professor Feyrer often changed his office hours so it was somewhat difficult to figure out when he was available.  Although he never responded to my blitzes he did always read them.  The only downside to this class, in my opinion, was that the exams were too easy.  Consequently, the median grades tended to be extremely high so getting an A basically meant you had to master all the material and execute analysis flawlessly on the exams.  This is especially difficult because his exams have True/False questions where he awards no partial credit.  Still, staying afloat wasn't too difficult as long as you were careful on the exams.  I would suggest this class even for non-majors.  Of course you would have to trudge through Econ 1 to get here, but if you manage to survive that you should definitely take this class.  It is much more interesting and pertinent to current events.

Not too hard, Feyrer is a very nice guy and he ties the lectures into current events nicely. The tests aren't too hard and the material is pretty interesting.

Feyrer is a great prof, although sometimes gives off the impression that he is too busy to teach and is kinda lazy when it comes to getting stuff done (like grading and making up tests). He likes to link stuff we're doing to the headlines of the day -- really helps you to learn to apply macro principles to something other than just the tests. The tests are pretty easy too - just study the practice tests he gives out. I'm SO glad I took this class with Feyrer, he made it very fun and interesting.
@
James Feyrer
/course/865
feyrer has a talent for lecturing; he is really easy to listen to and class flies by his slides sometimes had mistakes on them, though.  the class is pretty easy if you get the concepts. he posts sample midterms and there weren't unexpected questions on any of our exams.   what stops me from giving this course As is that i don't think the course pushes you at all. it's a lot of regurgitating graphs. i think it would have been better if we had some discussion/debate about current economic events instead of just listening to him talk about them.
@
James Feyrer
/course/865
The class is okay but professor feyrer is very lazy and egotistical. you will see thing when you visit him during office hours. the points on the tests were also unfairly distributed because one true false question is worth 5 points so if you miss one or two, you are out of luck
@
James Feyrer
/course/865
I don't really know what it is about this class, but it seemed hard.  The topics are interesting global economy, exchange rates, GDP, what the Fed is doing...  But the class is hard, I think.  It's not like Micro, where you learn some formulas and procedures and you're set.  It requires thinking and understanding econ pretty well.  Some info Prof. Feyrer lectures with powerpoints, and fast... Grade 2 midterms (25%), final (40%), hw (10%) Exams are 40% true/false (8 questions, 5 pts each)       if you screw up you lose 5 points, no partial Homeworks are collected and checked, not graded

@
James Feyrer
/course/865
Overall, Feyrer is not only a great guy, but also a really good lecturer. Other reviewers said they think he moves too quickly through slides, but I disagree. He's really enthusiastic about the subject, which made it a lot easier for me to be attentive at 845am.  Go to class because he occasionally has classes with lots of graphs which he purposely doesn't post on blackboard, so going to class really helps. The Mankiw book is very helpful as well. As for exams, the first midterm was easy and the second was somewhat harder - he posts old midterms with answer keys on blackboard so seriously just memorize the answers to the short answer questions and you'll be set.  Problem sets were not too time consuming compared to other econ classes I've taken.  My only complaint is that the final was significantly harder than either midterm and it definitely brought my grade down a little, but I'm still so glad I took the class from Feyrer since he's such a great prof.  As for how your grade is determined 2 midterms (30% each) problem sets - we had 7 total and you're not graded on them, just checked off for doing them (10%) final (30%)

Professor Feyrer is a great professor.  He is probably one of the best professors the Econ department has at Dartmouth and I recommend any student that has the chance to take him to do it!   During class, he answers any and all of your questions and takes time to make sure you understand, while maintaining a good pace of lecturing.  I came out of the class understanding macroeconomics more than I came in.  The exams were fairly difficult.  He didn't ask anything you wouldn't expect, but he loves to challenge his students, and I appreciate that a lot!   The final exam was a fair assessment of the course material.  Take Feyrer, not too hard, but not too easy either, Feyrer just loves to challenge you, and you will appreciate that throughout the entire course.  I haven't received my grade yet, which explains why I did not check that off above.

If you have to take this course, take it with Feyrer.  He makes the lectures interesting and applicable and definitely tries to stimulate students into participating in the lecture.  Sometimes he goes a bit too fast through the slides but you can always review them again on Blackboard.  You have to keep up with the readings and attend class because it's difficult to catch up once you're behind since the class moves fast.  Overall, the grading is pretty fair although he doesn't do a curve (at least not yet).
@

This was my first upper-level econ class and it was awesome.  The material was very interesting and Professor Feyrer did a great job of explaining it during class.  I think everyone should take this class at some time to learn about macroeconomics just because it's so practical.
@
James Feyrer
/course/865
I was planning on majoring in econ before this course, and now I'm sure about it. Feyrer is a great, energetic and excited lecturer, and makes the material interesting to learn. At times he went a little too fast, but Mankiw's text is very clear and well-written, so anyone could keep up in this course. Feyrer tries hard to relate macro to current events, which made the course seem more relevant. Some people might say that, compared with other economics topics, macro is boring, but this really isn't true. Once you get past the technical aspects of the models, this subject has important implications for government, policymaking and society at large - to be a responsible citizen, everyone should know the basics of macro. As for the work, the exams were easy enough, and Feyrer makes good use of blackboard to post old exams, homework keys, etc. Real nice guy too, and quite approachable in office hours.
@
James Feyrer
/course/865
Feyrer taught a nice no frills course. There was minimal homework, and all of it was directly related to the course. There were 2 midterms and a final, and everything was from the book. Too many visiting econ profs act like they are teaching a high-school class, and give way too many useless assignments and unnecessary readings. Feyrer did not do this, and taught this course like the college lecture class it is. For me this was very refreshing, as I know how to do my work and don't need unnecessary assignments to make me learn.
@
James Feyrer
/course/865
Professor Feyrer is an engaging, intelligent, and effective lecturer.  The material is interesting in and of itself, but it is also relevant to current events.  I can much better understand macroeconomic policy debates in newspapers.  I found that the tests were not overly challenging, but fair.  One of the best classes that I have taken at Dartmouth.
@

/course/865
Although this class covers a lot of ground and often times he clicks through his powerpoints very rapidly, I liked this class a lot.  Feyrer is easy to understand, knows what he's doing, and is very fair about weekly homework assignments and his exams. I would recommend this class.
@
James Feyrer
/course/865
Prof. Feyrer seems alright.  Then he decides to be the worst prof ever!  He thinks that if he says something once everybody in the class understands it right away.  He never teaches you the material, you have to learn it on your own.  He moves way too quickly, doesn't teach effectively, and is very boring.  He is condescending in office hours; he doesn't understand how someone can't understand something that he finds simple.  Every single person I know who was in either of the sections with him had the exact same criticisms.  For a while he seems like an ok prof, but once test time rolls around or once you go in for help or once you start working on the advanced material, things get horrible.  He tends to get ok reviews because as a guy he's great, very nice, interested in you, etc.  But as a teacher, HE IS HORRIBLE!  Avoid at all costs!
@
James Feyrer
/course/865
Professor Feyrer delivers good lectures, so it is definitely worth your time to attend class.  He explains things much better than the book.  He does post lecture slides online, but he does a fair amount of graphing on the board, so the lecture slides are more of a supplement.  Tests are True/False and Short Answer, and are pretty fair.  Midterms weren't too bad, the final was fairly tough.  Overall, I definitely recommend this prof for macro.
@
James Feyrer
/course/865
Overall, I thought Prof. Feyrer was a really good prof, one of the better I've had in the econ department. I read one of the other reviews by a kid from my section and I think it's way overblown and bitter, even as another student who didn't do GREAT in the course. I agree that aspects of Feyrer's test are a bit nit-picky and he definitely will test you on things he's only mentioned in class. If you're not innately good at econ, those questions can be hard because they're not always intuitive (at least for me). HOwever, I still found his tests to be pretty fair, depsite the fact that I didn't exaclty perform well on any of them. Feyrer's a really nice guy though and can be really helpful in office hours, so if you put in the effort, you can end up doing ok. I never scored above the mean on the tests and still pulled a B, so I think it was a fair course and Feyrer was as engaging of a prof as you can hope for in the econ department.

I expected Macro to be fairly dull but it is required for the major/minor.  Prof. Feyrer tries to breath some life into it but it's not easy to do.  My only complaint with him is I felt like he sometimes rushed through the intro to some of the models, but the book explains them fairly well.

I liked this class and the prof. The information is very relevant in understanding the way the world economy works. The textbook is a very helpful resource and Feyrer's lectures closely resemble what you will find in the text. Feyrer is a friendly, young professor who tries to link the class to current issues. His examinations are hard and are not curved. My one complaint is that he takes quite a long time to grade exams.
@
James Feyrer
/course/865
Feyrer is good but not great.  He flies through the material during lectures so it can be hard to grasp all the concepts during classtime.  You really need to spend time outside of class reviewing your class notes in order to learn the material.  However, you don't really need to do the reading, and there isn't much homework, so overall the class isn't overly time-consuming.  It's an interesting class, and I'd recommend it, even for non-majors.
@

Feyrer is intelligent, polite, and enthused.  He was good at answering questions and is always willing to clarify parts of his lectures if things get too fast.   The only thing that kinda sucked was that his tests had a lot of true/false questions.  Not that the exams were particularly hard, but it was easy to misinterpret a strangely worded true/false question and quickly lose 5 points.  Otherwise, everything about the course was great.

This is a pretty typical econ class.  If you do the readings from the textbook, you'll be fine.  The book is very readable and contains everything you need for exams. As far as lectures, they are quite unnecessary.  Feyrer never deviates from his mundane PowerPoint presentations.  He even posts the slides from each class on blackboard.  If I were to take this class again, I would read the book and skip lectures.

Feyrer is a great prof.  Gets right to the point and is very energetic in the classroom.  Pretty easy course and the midterms are very easy if you study from the previous exams that he posts before each midterm.  The final exam should've been easy, but it was pretty unfair, i thought, because the questions were not necessarily taken from ideas emphasized throught the term.  Other than the ending, it was a great course to take with Feyrer.

An excellent class.  Professor Feyrer is a great lecturer, and he successfully made some otherwise dry material interesting and applicable, specifically by focusing on modern examples and implications.  Take this class with Feyrer if at all possible
@

Feyrer is very straightforward.  No surprises when you get to exams.  He's a really interesting lecturer and provides good powerpoints as well.  My one complaint was that his wording on tests is sometimes a little vague, but he's reasonable in giving you back credit if you tell him afterwards.

i had a good time in this classs, especially after suffering thru 21 with bar-ilan. Feyrer seemed really into the material and inspired interest, he would also incorporate current events whcich made the material more relevant. the entire course was on blackboard which was useful. it was a suprisingly interesting class, i would reccomend it even for non majors
@
James Feyrer
/course/865
Of the three theory classes required in the Econ major (20, 21 and 22), this is by far the easiest probably because the dept. doesn't offer a true intro. macro class (econ 1 is most certainly micro-oriented).  As a result, this course is a comprimise between an intro class and a true intermediate level class. Feyrer is a chill guy.  He's an inspiring lecturer too and really wants his students to see the applications of the theory their learning to the real world (just read a newspaper - it's all macro stuff). The exams are fair, though a change in format wouldn't hurt (his T/F questions are sometimes subtle to the point of absurdity) - but people perform very well nonetheless. If you need to double up on econ for a term, this is a good second class to take.

Feyrer loves macroeconomics, and it shows.  His lectures are exceptionally organized, topical, and very helpful.  He's an energetic lecturer; he can keep you awake even in a Winter 9L.  The coolest part of this course is you get to study how policy affects the economy, so you can call B.S. on all the people you see on TV.  A word of warning on the exams Feyrer is not above making you memorize economic statistics or formulas.  His exams are fair, but if you want an A in this class, you'll need to work hard to distinguish yourself from the pack.  There's no easy grade inflation here.

Feyrer is a fun happy prof.  Now and then he sits on a table and swings his legs like a kid at Christmas.  He's unintimidating, very available through office hours, friendly, and a good teacher.  I really have no complaints.  Of course, I like Econ classes so I'm bound to generally enjoy them . . . . but this was one of the better classes I've taken.
@

/course/865
I have no complaints about this course as it was taught.  The prof was engaging and well prepared, and the exams were fair.  My only frustration was that the prof did not include charts in the powerpoint slides, but do I really have a right to complain about that?  I do have some beef with the registrar/department, who decided to have only one section and make it a 9.  I know at least 2 people who couldn't get into the class.  Also, I cannot function at 845 in the morning so I couldn't go to class all too often, meaning I had to learn almost all the material from the lecture notes or the book.  I know I am not the only person who had this problem.  That said, I recommend this class to anyone interested in finance.  It will be helpful in interviews and on the job.

I liked the class. The exams were pretty tough, but Avner provided practice exams that were very helpful when studying. I wouldn't say the class was particularly interesting, but Avner was a good lecturer and held our attention. I've heard Avner is tougher than other Macro classes, but it was still enjoyable.
@
Avner Bar-Ilan
/course/865
Prof Bar-Ilan is a good prof who is responsive to students and basically wants students to do well in his class. He was available outside of class and was interested in helping students during office hours. I found his accent to be tough to understand during the beginning of the course but I got used to it and then it was not a problem.  I found the material pretty dry but not too difficult.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend taking this class out of interest alone, and it is not an easy 3rd class.
@
Avner Bar-Ilan

Really interesting class; initially a bit of a learning curve, but once you get used to Avner's style, the class becomes very engaging and you learn a lot.  Grades consisted of 25% MT1, 25% MT2, and 50% final (I wasn't a fan of the distribution). Exams are tough but fair, and he provides plenty of practice exams.  Good, solid class that inspired interest for macro.

/course/865
Professor Bar-Ilan was great.  His lectures were incredibly well organized and flowed perfectly.  He didn't use powerpoint, forcing students to stay alert and follow along.  Also, he would occasionally call on students, another trick that forced me to pay attention.  Despite sometimes confusing material I thought Bar-Ilan  did a great job laying out the material and the tests, while tough, were also very fair.  My favorite econ prof and class at Dartmouth yet.
@
Avner Bar-Ilan
/course/865
Seriously, if you're going to summer through an  Econ class, then take it with Avner. He is quite possibly the only professor from whom I've learned the reason for what I'm learning.   He might be super intimidating at first, but he's really a nice all-round guy.  He's the only prof with whom an economics course does not entail rote memorization of the problem sets but actually requires you to understand the material.  Working is study groups is a must, especially when you're looking over his practice exams and realize that a 6-page test has a 4 letter answer key.   Study a lot for this class and you'll learn a lot.
@
Avner Bar-Ilan
/course/865
The curriculum for this class is pretty extensive, so if you want to master it, you should plan on spending a bunch of time studying.  The problem sets he gives out are optional, but you should do them for practice.  As he said at the beginning of the term for us, doing a lot of problems will be good practice for the exams.  Two midterms and a final account for your entire grade in this course.
@
Avner Bar-Ilan
/course/865
22 is dry, but then again, so is econ in general.  If you have no real interest in describing national economies this class will be boring and at time excruciating.  Avner is a solid prof, though he has a very aggressive style of teaching that can actually be fairly intellectually engaging.  Often he derived something mathematically on the board, then asked for an economic intuition for the result.  Many a time no one had any idea, and multiple people would answer incorrectly to Avner's slight annoyance, but it got the mental juices flowing.  Although if you don't want to put yourself out there by answering questions, he won't force you.
@
Avner Bar-Ilan
/course/865
It didn't seem like the tests were a fair representation of what we were learning.  Also, the lectures were pretty boring, and the teacher will just keep stopping to ask the class a question, but doesn't even hint at the answer, wanting some random piece of information that people will only come up with 50% of the time, and it just wastes class time.
@
Avner Bar-Ilan
/course/865
Reading is not that important. I guess it would help but most essential is attending his lectures as he covers a lot during class. Notes from a friend would be hard to understand if you weren't there. And he often asks for economic reasoning behind formulae and numbers so keep that in mind. It helps to really understand the concepts anyways. For midterms and final, practice the past tests and prob sets. He's a reasonable grader and he does curve. Also, he's nice so if you need help, do go to his office hour.
@
Avner Bar-Ilan
/course/865
Bar-Ilan is a nice guy.  As a professor, his lectures are difficult to follow.  Thus, on his tests, you're often left lost and wondering what's going on.  I did not enjoy this class and I don't know many people who do not feel the same way.
@
Avner Bar-Ilan
/course/865
The prof was fairly stubborn to any type of insight by students. The material was interesting, but I don't think the exams were a good assessment to how well you knew the material. All of the practice tests were similar material and format, but then the actual tests were a different format and weren't on main topics.
@
Avner Bar-Ilan
/course/865
Yes, Avner is tough.  But he's the best econ professor I've had so far at Dartmouth (this was my 6th econ class).  This was a 9 but I was engaged the whole time.  The tests are hard but Avner gives you many ways to prepare 3 practice tests, problem sets, answers to the book chapter questions.    Advice do the problems at the end of the chapters.  Know everything backwards and forwards and you'll do fine.

@

/course/865
Avner is a good guy, I'll never deny that. But... his teaching method was not conducive to my learning style. I had a very, very difficult time applying that which he taught me on his exams. To me, his exams were nothing like the previous exams he distributed and were too far from those things on which he lectured. I had a very difficult time in this class and am expecting a very poor grade. The worst part about it was simply that I've never worked harder for a class and done so poorly. It was really unrewarding.
@
Avner Bar-Ilan
/course/865
You have to take it some time.  Yes, Avner scared the crap out of me, but perhaps he scared me smart.  It's not easy and Avner flies, but if you pay attention and take good advantage of the practice stuff he gives (it's good stuff), you should be able to do OK.  He asks some bizarre/incomprehensible questions on the tests that didn't make sense to me (language barrier?  Who knows), but he also gave lots of credit to my equally bizarre/incomprehensible answers, so I'd call it a draw.  Definitely cute and cuddly, so get ready to team up with classmates to tough it out - I don't think you could pay me enough to hang out with him in office hours.  Kind of like Mr. Clean, but sort of militaristic and Israeli.

Professor Bar-Ilan is the best prof I've had at Dartmouth.  He is a great lecturer, he really helps students to understand the subject, and his tests are fair.  He is one of the hidden gems not just in the Econ department, but in the entire Dartmouth faculty. I really liked Macro, too.  I'd recommend taking it, but if your schedule permits it, hold out until you can take it with Bar-Ilan.  He only teaches about one term a year.  Even if you aren't a major, this class will probably be enjoyable.  It's a heavier than average workload but well worth the time you put into it.

To be honest I couldn't understand the professor for the entire first week.  Luckily by the end I had a pretty good idea of what he was saying.  Bar-Ilan is a very intelligent guy, and he understands his macroeconomics.  I enjoyed class with him.  He is always very helpful when it comes to answering questions and explaniing things.  The class does move very quickly though, so watch out.  I started missing class, and it wasn't pretty.  The entire grade is based on the two midterms and the final.  No homework at all.  It's nice if you really know your Econ, and aren't afraid of a little cramming.  If you're the hard-working type, you have plenty of material to work on.  Also, a small note to anyone who takes this class - the final is HEAVILY weighted towards open economy macroeconomics.  It's "cummulative" in a sense, but I had no idea just how limited it scope it was.  Make sure you REALLY know your stuff.
@
Avner Bar-Ilan
/course/865
Yes Bar-Ilan has a thick accent, but if you can deal with it, you'll find that his lectures are definitely worth it.  He explains everything really well, and is excellent at drawing and relating to one another the numerous graphs which macro is probably famous for.  I found the text book used in this class next to worthless, especially compared to the lectures.  His lectures also didn't really follow the book, so I recommend just making sure you go to every class and taking really good notes.
@
Avner Bar-Ilan
/course/865
This course is one of the most interesting classes I have ever taken at Dartmouth.  I love Macroeconomics, but sometimes Professor Bar-Ilan confused me (especially because of his accent). The textbook does not follow Bar-Ilan's lectures well and sometimes I had to use other textbooks in order to understand some of the concepts that were introduced in class.  For this class there are two midterms and one final exam.  The difficulty of all three were the same and quite fair.  However, he tested us on outside articles that pertain to the course.  I felt that they were useless and they required too much memorization.  Overall, I think he should remove those articles questions from his exams and he should get a much better textbook that matches his lectures!!!!!

@
Avner Bar-Ilan
/course/865
It takes an extraordinary prof to make the ideas of macroeconomics seem confusing and unfortunately, Bar-Ilan is that extraordinary prof. The lectures were quite poor. Taking notes proved to be a difficult task, because Bar-Ilan doesn't write much down and if he does, it's usually just a word here or there. His explanations during lectures just make the subject matter more confusing.  Despite a good amazon.com rating, the textbook (Macroeconomics by Hall & Taylor) wasn't very helpful, mainly because Bar-Ilan follows it very loosely. In fact, I dug up a textbook I'd used in the past,(Principles of Macroeconomics by N. Gregory Mankiw), and it clarified the material immensely.  I strongly suggest taking this course with a different professor.
@
Avner Bar-Ilan
/course/865
The class was good, the material was interesting, and I felt as though I learned a lot. His accent is thick, but i got used to it within the first couple lectures. He expects you to do the work and ask him when you don't understand--if you do that you'll be fine. The midterms had low medians and the final was hard, but everything gets curved in the end. I'm not a major, but if you like macro and don't mind doing some work, take this class.

This being the second course I have taken with Avner, I can say without reservation that he is one of the best profs at this school.  From a personal standpoint, you can tell he cares about his students (he calls all the students by their first names during class) and loves teaching econ.  As a teacher Avner is definetly tough but thoroughly effective.  His lectures are incredibly lucid if you can keep up, and his tests are based exclusively on material covered in lectures.  A lot of people complain about the tests, but if you are an econ major I suggest putting in the extra time with avner as it will make any subsequent econ course seem like a breeze.

This course was amazing, if you want to come out of 22 knowing macro, prof. Bar-Ilan is the man to take the course with.  His exams and in class questions will work you, but you will be better off because of it.  He is also very nice and gives interesting and timely lectures using current events and real macro situations. If you can take this course with Bar-Ilan do so, if you put in a little work you will be rewarded.
@

This class was ok.  The material was a little dry because it is a prereq type course.  The main problem I had with the class was the prof's accent.  I know that sounds silly, but it was slightly difficult to understand him at times.
@
Avner Bar-Ilan
/course/865
I think taking macro with Prof. Bar-Ilan may be a little more difficult than taking it with other profs, but I felt I left with a good grasp of the material.  Bar-Ilan progresses through the material in a very logical fashion and draws examples from current events when appropriate.  His accent may cause some confusion in the beginning, but I found I got used to it pretty quickly.  The concepts covered in macro are fairly straightforward so as long as you keep up with the readings the class shouldn't pose too much of a problem.

Professor DeSantis is an amazing professor.  He's hilarious and endearing (you won't have any actual idea until you actually take his class).  Every day there's always a good laugh and that makes the material a bit less dry.  As for actual teaching, Professor DeSantis is great.  He explains concepts very well and is pretty straightforward.  The actual material is extremely easy if you've ever taken a macroeconomics course before.  Macroeconomics is essentially logic, so if you're a logical person, you should do fairly well in the course.  The beginning of the course is pretty dry but it gets interesting, in my opinion, when we reach statistical analysis and start analyzing monetary and fiscal policy.

With De Santis macro is interesting and not that difficult. You don't use the book, he manipulates the models so less calculus is involved but they work out nicely, and he has clear, detailed handouts to substitute for what would be pertinent readings in the text. The problem sets are not too much work, but they really help introduce the material and are very similar to the exams. The exams were all very fair, and he gives out practice tests before each one that really help you prepare for them.
@
Massimiliano DeSantis
/course/865
This class gives you an overview of what's going on in the world and the prof is very enthusiastic about what he's teaching.  I would highly recommend this class.  One problem set a week and practice midterms all help in learning the material for the tests.

I didn't like DeSantis' attitude in class.  He doesn't teach, but instead just says things and expects you to understand.  Asking him questions will usually do little to clarify things.  The subject matter, in general, is fairly interesting.  DeSantis does a good job of making it relevant and applying it to the real world, which is much appreciated.  There are weekly problem sets which can take quite a bit of time to do but are fairly helpful.  The first midterm was in many ways, unlike anything we did in class, but the next two tests weren't as egregious.  Make sure to pay attention to details in class and take good notes and go over them for the exams.
@
Massimiliano DeSantis
/course/865
Massi is sometimes a funny guy, but as a professor he's one of the worst I've had. He avoids answering questions directly, sometimes I think because he doesn't understand the material well enough to do so. But he thinks he's really cool and is incredibly full of himself. He also has questionable grading methods, curving our first midterm so that the worse your grade the less the curve helped you.
@
Massimiliano DeSantis
/course/865
Professor DeSantis is a good prof for Econ 22.  He is a character with a unique personality.  People will tell you that he comes off as arrogant, and yea, he does, but hes really not.  All the other reviews probably mention how hard his first midterm was, but that's mainly because no one studied correctly for it.  FOR MIDTERMS AND THE FINAL, STUDY YOUR NOTES AS WELL AS PRACTICE PROBLEMS.  I REPEAT, NOTES NOTES NOTES AS WELL AS PRACTICE PROBLEMS.  Everyone thought the first test was going to be all problems and when it had some concepts / derivations covered in class... people were clueless (and the mean was ridiculously low).  But it really wasn't that hard of a test.  If you can, take this class.
@
Massimiliano DeSantis
/course/865
This course is designed, I assume, as a weeder-course for Economics majors.  It takes that a bit too far.  I thought that the academic value of the course was certainly worth taking it, but I felt that the testing process was meant to do way more than test a simple understanding of the material.   Prof. DeSantis was not very clear in how he designed his exams at first.  This fact led 15 out of 70 people enrolled in this class with him to drop the class after the first midterm.  Clearly, that is a problem that needs to be fixed, whether with the course design or the professor himself. Prof. Massi DeSantis can be very harsh with students, and--if they don't know how to deal with it--they can become quite offended.  Occasionally, he would look at students oddly after they had asked a question, conveying the "What, are you stupid?" reaction that wasn't quite said in words but seemed to come across.

i was really excited to take the course b/c i heard that this course will let you be able to understand what's going on in the economy and WSJ. turned out to be not exactly what i expected. the material is interesting but it gets very frustrating when the prof is unclear about certain things and when students ask him, he is like you should know! material is not too difficult to grasp. exams are fair.
@
Massimiliano DeSantis
/course/865
Massi is the kind of teacher that you loathe while you're taking his class and his tests, but love at the end. He presses you to work your hardest and challenges you a great deal on tests, but at the end, after the final, you realize how much you have learned in his class.  His first test surprised about 90% of the class in its difficulty, but also persuaded the entire class to respect the material more and give it the time it deserves. As a result, the class median on tests went up on the second midterm.   His problem sets didn't really count towards your grade if you did them, but they helped a lot in understanding the material and making sure you read the book for the full description of each of the models.  Throughout the term, I said my share of curses while studying for Massi's class, but now a few days after my final and recognizing how much I have learned, I can only sing his praises.
@
Massimiliano DeSantis
/course/865
He belittles the class, and while he demonstrates his extensive knowledge of the material, I would recommend NOT taking Macro with him.  I'm a major, and it's professors like him in the department that make me wonder why I am a major.  I would take 22 with Professors like Feyrer or Rose.
@
Massimiliano DeSantis
/course/865
Although studying notes were required before taking exam, I know most of mine were not all that cohesive. When Desantis remembered to tell you what section he was moving onto (not always following the book in lieu of his more "sophisticated" model), he was great. Otherwise, it was hard to follow the lectures only a few minutes after class ended.

This is one of the most interesting classes that I have taken at Dartmouth, and deSantis is a great prof. Yes, he goes through material pretty quickly, but if you pay attention, you'll be able to grasp it pretty easily. Also, he jokes at random times and relates everything to real-life scenarios, so the lectures are pretty interesting.  Everyone says the tests were too hard, but in reality, they just did not study the concepts. This course is pretty theoretical, so it's useless just memorizing formulas with no knowledge of how they are derived.  The best way to do well in this class is to attend as many lectures as you can (which you will, because everyone receives a participation grade partially based upon attendance) and take good notes. If you do that, I can guarantee that you'll learn A LOT and get a good grade.

This class/prof got great reviews for seemingly no reason.  the class is paced too fast, not enough examples are given, and nothing is explained enough for the way DeSantis tests you.  the exams weren't fair based on the homework assignments given (which are just a check or a check minus depending upon if you do all the questions in the assignment).  DeSantis may seem like a great guy, but he's awful at providing the students with the tools necessary to do well in the class.  Take this class with someone else.

The course is great. Macroeconomics is an inherently interesting subject that you'll find useful when you're reading the WSJ - you'll actually understand what they're saying.  That said, DO NOT take it with DeSantis. He has no idea what he's doing. There is no structure to the course whatsoever. He skipped over a lot of chapters in the book, spent too much time on some topics, and didn't even address important things like Foreign Exchange or International Trade. What a disaster.  His lectures were disorganized and uninspired. It was hard to find what he was saying in the book. The book itself was a pain to read. The problem sets had no relation to what he taught in class or what was in the book (at least near the end). The tests were ambiguous and his grading moreso.  I felt like I learnt nothing and was cheated out of a class that had great potential. If you want to actually learn something, take it with someone else.
@

I absolutely loved Econ 22. Professor DeSantis is a clear lecturer who obviously loves teaching. When units got tricky, he would post his lecture notes on Blackboard for everyone to look at! He's also a really funny guy who would make jokes during class to get everyone smiling. The homework sets aren't very difficult if you've taken detailed notes as the problems come straight from the lecture. Tests exactly resemble homework setsâ€“ you'll do fine if you've done the homework. In all, Professor DeSantis made macro really fun, and I'd recommend him to anyone!

Interesting enough, Massi isn't a great prof but he isn't a bad one either.  Decent lecturer, makes a joke here and there, seems to enjoy teaching.  Class consisted of weekly homeworks, 2 midterms, and a final.  Exam problems were always multi-part and often conceptual - they really were a good test of how well you understood macro, not how well you could plug in numbers.
@
Massimiliano DeSantis
/course/865
DeSantis is a good guy -- he's pretty funny and is generally nice when you talk with him.  As a teacher, however, he was, in my opinion, lacking.  He moved very quickly in class, and his lectures and tests didn't correspond at all with the book, making the book basically pointless (we used Campbell).  I felt like your grade in the class was unrelated to how much work you put in, but how well you understood DeSantis when he lectured.  To be fair, it was his a first time teaching, so he'll probably get better, and he might find a book that fits his course better.     If you are going to take this class with him, here's a suggestion don't just take the notes he writes on the board, they're pretty sparse, take extensive notes on everything he talks about.
@
Massimiliano DeSantis
/course/865
This was a somewhat weird class.  Very unstructured in my opinion.  The prof covered whatever he wanted, went off on tangents, did not really stick to the textbook, and brought up some weird examples in class.  This made the class more interesting than your typical econ lecture course, but it was very frustrating at times.  The tests are ridiculous.  They are very hard. Prof de Santis (or Massi as I call him) always throws weird problems into his tests.  He never makes a straightforward exam to just test the basic material or to follow the textbook - he always tries to "spice" up his exams with interesting - but difficult - problems that seek to "educate" and "enlighten" the test-taker along the way.  This is like Massi's inside joke.  The result - tests are way too hard, too long, and class averages are in the 70s.    Given the fact that the median is a B+, curves are huge, meaning that just because you think you failed an exam - as I thought after taking every one of them - doesnt mean you actually did.  This creates a lot of frustration though.    I have a sort of love-hate relationship with this course.  On the one hand, its interesting, and Massi is a great guy.  Hes got his own distinct style, and I respect that.  I think most people like him.  However, his style, while making the class more interesting, also makes it more difficult.   Thus, this is the economic trade-off that you face.  I say, take it.  You'll have fun.  Massi loves jokes - feel free to make econ jokes during class.  Find yourself a nice study partner and have fun doing the problem sets.  But most importantly - ALWAYS COME TO CLASS...AND DO NOT FALL BEHIND.  Come to class because he brings up things that are not in the textbook, and you never know what he's going to throw on the exam.  And do not fall behind because if you do...you won't understand the new things that Massi brings up in class that aren't in the textbook, and then again you're possibly screwed for the exam.    The textbook is not the best by the way.  And if worst comes to worst, just BS your exam - Massi gives a lot of partial credit.  My grades are almost like a joke - I'm not sure how I managed a decent grade because I still don't exactly know the things he covered.  Good times.

Prof DeSantis writes tough tests because he really wants you to know all the intuition backwards and forwards of what he teaches (not what the book teaches). The problem with this is that this is not what he teaches in the lectures, which are very dry and boring. The homeworks help to connect the pieces a lot, but you're still left to figure some hard material out of exams, and he grades them harshly as well. He is also very unapproachable I found during office hours or after class, almost bordering on completely unhelpful. He actually made me feel bad for asking him to explain a question on the exam that I didn't understand after we got them back... I wouldn't recommend him for Econ 22 at least, but I think he's a smart guy and he has potential as a professor when he learns to be more approachable and realistic on exams.

Prof. DeSantis is a nice guy. He presents the information clearly.   However, he does not make the material come alive. He does not explain the intuition. In the homework sets and on the tests, you need to have a very deep and thorough understanding of the subject that you do not receive in class. You are left to explain everything to yourself. Unfortunately, this is a very difficult process because Prof. DeSantis does not follow the book very closely.   The tests are pretty difficult. I would definitely not recommend taking macroeconomics with Prof. DeSantis. I am leaving the course with very little understanding of the subject, despite attending class, studying hard and reading the book.

Professor DeSantis is one of the best teachers I've ever had.  He is a funny lecturer, his material is interesting, and makes the homework really REALLY useful.  This is the first class I've ever had where studying homework is a legitimate way of studying.  One "problem" is that he deviates from the book a lot - we never use it - and if you don't pay attention in lectures, you are pretty much way behind in class.   But you can always see him in Office Hours and he is great at explaining things.

i went into macro thinking it'd be a good change from econ1, especially because i didn't do too well with the mathematical part of econ1... but econ22 wasn't too promising.. Prof. DeSantis doesn't do a very good job lecturing and seems to expect a lot from students. his office hours were not helpful at all (at times, almost condescending at times).. the subject itself is very interesting, especially the great depression... but it'll require a lot of work on your part. the homework assignments aren't too rough, but the exams are pretty tough, especially because of the grading.

Prof. Lusardi is awesome.  She is hilarious and makes learning easy.  You get the feeling that she really wants to teach you the subject and wants for you to do well.  The course is all laid out and it is clear to all students what they need to do to succeed in the course.  She is approachable, friendly and a great teaching professor.

Econ. 22 is probably the easiest class in the economics department.  It is also interesting, esp. the discussions about Social Security reform and balancing the budget.  Prof. Lusardi was great, too.  She encouraged class participation and made students feel comfortable in class.  She even memorized all of our names in advance--using the Green Book i think.  She knew the material perfectly and was willing to go over it as many times as necessary.  I would recommend this class even to non-majors.
@
Annamaria Lusardi
/course/865
Take this class with someone else.  The way Professor Lusardi teaches this course, it's a rehash of econ 1, 21, 26 and 27.  If you've not taken any of those courses, I'm sure you'll find the class very interesting.  However, if you know anything about economics, you will be borded senseless.  Half of the class is spent on issues that have little to do with macroeconomics, while other professors for the same class teach many more models for the economy.  Professor Lusardi is a very nice person and very easy going but the class is too easy, too boring, and too unoriginal to warrant a good recommendation.  One of the worst in the department.
@
Annamaria Lusardi
/course/865
There are innumerable methods with which professors teach macroeconomics. Professor Lusardi's was relatively simple mathematically, with nothing more than a handful of identities to memorize from which all related equilibria could be derived. None of the concepts were conceptually demanding. The tedious aspect, however, was memorizing Lusardi's factoid-laden lecture notes for the "recall" section of her exams. Though not difficult, it proved time-consuming and, frankly, annoying (the kind of thing you could do in middle school but at which point seemed, and still does seem, stupid). The textbook seemed to be designed in this manner as well.   Thus, while Professor Lusardi is a solid lecturer (though by no means entertaining), I would (especially if you are a major and plan to do further work in economics-related fields) search out sections of Econ22 that are more mathematically rigorous and less memorization-oriented. It's the only way you'll ever be able to grasp fully the more intricate designs of modern economics (which, as can be revealed by pursuing an issue of Econometrica, are often more mathematically rigorous than contemporary physics).
@
Annamaria Lusardi
/course/865
Econ 22 is one of those "Damn, do I have to take this to complete the major?" classes. Most people don't expect much. And, to be honest, I was skeptical when I walked in the first day and Lusardi began by speaking monotone, and I thought I would never make it through the lecture. I'm glad I didn't drop it though Lusardi turned out to be a fantastic professor. Unlike many econ professors who are brilliant but incapable of teaching, Lusardi has an uncanny ability to convey with perfect intelligibility every concept in macroeconomics. Her exams are fair and she makes an effort to get to know everyone. You can tell she is a professor that really cares, and in a large intro class, that's refreshing and appreciated.

A lot of people complain that this is a boring course.  I have no idea what they are talking about.  Maybe I'm just an econ dork, but I really liked going to this class and learning about all the macroeconomic stuff.  It wasn't too much work and the tests were pretty good.  Prof Lusardi is very nice, but she can be a little hard to understand at first.  But that really shouldnt keep someone from taking this class with her.
@

I was scared of econ but I loved this class! Professor Lusardi was very helpful and answered our questions, though sometimes she went too slowly. The beginning of each class was a review of the previous class, and the slides were simplistic. (I loved all of this though, because otherwise I think the class would have been too difficult for non-majors). The tests were easy enough, and the problem sets were qualitative, based on the reading assignments.

Professor Curtis is the best.  1) She's unbelievably nice.   2) She's very understanding if you have some extenuating circumstances. 3) The problem sets actually prepare you for the tests.  In fact, the tests resemble the problem sets very closely. 4) Her lectures are organized and posted online. 5) She's very easy to approach in office hours, and will help you with your problem set if you're having problems.  TAKE THIS WITH CURTIS!!  The problem sets and midterms were pretty easy, but the final is a bit tricky -- but that's because I didn't prepare enough.
@
Elisabeth Curtis
/course/865
Curtis is a great prof, and her lectures are clear and they explain the concepts really well.  The problem sets are great preparation for the exams, and she is always available to help you if you need help on the homework or before exams.  It's unfortunate that she isn't permanently teaching this course, but if she teaches it in the future, make sure to take with curtis.
@
Elisabeth Curtis
/course/865
It's Econ 22, so there is no way to change the material.  I find this stuff pretty interesting, but some people think Economics is dry.  Regardless, if you want to major/minor in Econ you need to take this class, and there is no better professor than Curtis.    She really explains the material well and always is willing to offer extra help if you need it.  As long as you read the textbook chapters before class, review your power point notes after class, and ask Curtis when you don't understand something, you should do well.  The class is weighted 20% is problem sets, 20% for each of the 2 midterms, and 40% for the final.  There's really no room to b.s. your way through the class because you won't do well on a Curtis test if you don't know your stuff.  As long as you do your work and try hard, you should be fine.

Many find this course not to hard but I found it nearly impossible, for three reasons.  First I was pledging a frat and second my sport was in season.  Third my other two classes were quite difficult as well.  So with little time to study this class suffered.  My recommendation to econ majors is during pledge term simply take a term off of econ and take easier classes (especially true if you are an athlete).     I really enjoy economics and I found this class harder than my previous econ classes but without given distractions quite manageable.  Curtis is very willing to help outside of class

Diego Comin
/course/865
Comin is a great professor. I loved the way we focused on macroeconomic applications to the real world and examined policies enacted by various countries. The case studies were interesting to get into. However, the class was a bit unorganized, especially in terms of grading. Your grade is almost entirely participation (the midterm doesn't really count). This makes grades a bit arbitrary since he bases it off of what he remembers you saying in class (he doesn't take notes). The department as a whole has to set a B median, so grades are definitely a worry. Don't be afraid to speak up, but also recognize that your chances of getting an A- or an A are fairly slim. Also, keep in mind that every class is basically discussion based and he doesn't really teach the concepts from the textbook (we skip a bunch of chapters). That said, there is barely any work to do before classes due to their structure and the final is an easy take home case study so if you're looking for a light load, go ahead. If you're looking for lecture based learning and a concrete grading scheme, Comin probably isn't right for you.
@
Diego Comin
/course/865
Comin is a great guy and a great prof. He gives good lectures. Only thing his class is entirely discussion-based, so if you're shy/not willing to speak up you'll have a hard time in this class. Otherwise, an easy and chill class with only one midterm and a take-home case study as your final.
@

Comin was the best professor I've had so far at Dartmouth. Really great guy, who not only cares about students but makes class interesting. Your grade is mostly based on class participation though, so you have to speak up.
@
Diego Comin
/course/865
Don't take this class with Comin. There's very little work because only one midterm, but 40% of the grade is participation and he told us in class the midterm grade doesn't really matter. We learned very little because every single person in the class would have their hands raised at all times, most of the time asking questions that were directly written or answered in the textbook. He also grades participation on a B median curve, which doesn't make any sense in an econ class because everybody is super competitive. He also doesn't care about quality of comment, just quantity. Only good part of the class was the cases
@
Diego Comin
/course/865
Comin is a nice guy and knows his stuff but I had mixed feelings about the way it's taught. Your grade is mostly participation, there's 1 midterm that is super easy and you just need to skim the textbook readings so that you have something "smart" to say in class. To get a good grade all you need to do is prepare for the case studies (that are interesting) and talk in class. Because the class is so chill, I came out not learning much. Also the heavy weightage on participation incentivized people to talk for the sake of talking, decreasing the quality of in-class discussion. He is rarely available for office hours either.  If you want an easy Econ 22 class, Comin is the way to go. If you want to really learn something, take it with somebody else, like Rose.
@
Diego Comin
/course/865
DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH COMIN. Your grade is almost entirely participation based. If you're shy, this class is NOT for you. Because participation is such a big part of your grade everyone always has their hands up trying to ask a question or make a comment. People would say anything for the sake of just talking in class. Most of the questions asked were directly answered in the textbook. Comin tallies up how many times people talk per class in determining participation grade, so people valued quantity over quality in their class participation. Comin definitely had favorites in class. It didn't matter if you had your hand held for the longest time of if you're normally very reserved and finally mustered up the courage to raise your hand. If you were one of his favorite students, he would call on you when you had your hand up. It was very annoying to see the same people getting called on over and over. The class only has one midterm and one final take home case study paper, but those didn't matter in comparison to participation. You go through a lot of case studies in the class. He would specifically look for certain things to be mentioned during the discussion. If he called on you and you didn't answer what he was looking for he'd just move on to the next person. I really don't think you gain as much out of learning macroeconomics with Comin as you could have with any other professor.

Fahri Ulusoy
/course/865
Overall, Econ 22 had very little work, was fairly easy, but not super interesting.  While our professor, Fahri Ulusoy, is a good lecturer and explainer, his lectures had frustratingly little interactivity.  He hardly ever asked us questions, nor even if we had questions.  He never had us solve problems in class, (as in do a worksheet).        Ulusoy also could have given us more homework assignments.  We only had 4 problem sets out of the Mankiw textbook (a great textbook by the way) worth of practice the whole term, so each one was worth about 5% of the grade.  I accidentally forgot to turn in one problem set and was afraid my grade would be ruined, but Ulusoy was very nice about giving me credit. In fact, I took five photos of the homework with my phone and Ulusoy was kind enough to print out each individual photo and staple them together and give me full credit.  I appreciate that.         There were two midterms and a final.  The first midterm was super easy.  As a result Ulusoy made the second midterm and final somewhat tricky.  He also graded the free response a little to subjectively in a few cases.  For example, he would ask for three important differences between CPI and GDP deflator and if you listed three that weren't what he considered the most important, you would only get partial credit.  Everything was fairly double.  I simply read over my notes, occasionally read parts of the Mankiw textbook, and did the practice exams that Ulusoy posted on Canvas and was able to score pretty decently.   	 Lastly in Fall 2016 when I took ECON 22, it was offered as a 1.5 hour 10A block, so even though the material wasn't uninteresting, I began to see it as so after passively being lectured at for an hour and a half.  I also couldn’t help but get distracted by the cute freshmen girls that seem to be present in every introductory econ and math class at Dartmouth.
@
Fahri Ulusoy
/course/865
Take it with Ulusoy! Although the lectures can be a bit boring, but there is close to zero work! There was only 4 problem sets in the whole term, and each problem set had like 3 questions, so we only had like 12 problems to do the whole term. You'll do very well in the class if you score well on the two midterms and the final.

Prof. Ulusoy tends to go pretty fast but he is a decent lecturer and is super nice outside class. I missed his office hours once and emailed him the night before the final, and he still replied and was very helpful. His tests weren't incredibly easy but definitely fair and I personally think he was a fair grader as well. The material gets pretty dry at times but it's not that awful.

Carl M. Campbell III is an econ prof trying to quit his day job to go into stand up comedy.

Then when he's done, he explains why the corny joke he just made is funny and laughs at it himself.    Other than that the class is pretty much a breeze.  There is a project and you can work on it with another person, but its pretty simple.  He's a nice guy, albeit a little disorganized but goood to visit in office hours.    Just try not to stare at his combover.

Andrew Levin
/course/865
A big fan of this class. Instead of taking midterms, you and a partner have to give 3 presentations on a country of your choosing. There a couple quizzes - but they are all very straight forward, and all under 10 minutes. No midterms or finals!  As well as being one of the leaders in his field (He was very senior at the FED), Levin is extremely passionate about his students and is always available to meet with you whenever you need help. He is also genuinely very interested in his students and wants them to work together as much as possible.  The workload is manageable as long you do not things last minute - you do have to put in a lot of work into your presentations. This class is more about you and your fellow classmates teaching each other - I would not recommend taking this class if you do have a fairly strong macro+micro background and not that interested in Economics. If you   are able to work in a team, enjoy economics, enjoy research, and willing to ask interesting questions - you will do very well in this class.

If you are a major or minor I recommend that you take this course because it helps set the tone for all the WGST classes that you will take.  The issues discussed in this class are very relevant to the society we live in today that is filled with all types of discrimination based on sex, class, and gender among other things.    If you have lived in a bubble all your life I recommend this class for you to open your eyes to other people's experiences that you may not be aware of.  The class was mainly discussion and Professor A'ness was a really good facilitator.  The coursework is not that bad although there is a good amount of reading.    Grades are based on journal entries, participation, a final exam paper, a media file, and forum theater (you get to act in the class as well).  This class was an eye opener for many and if you feel that you haven't been challenged to think about how others have to live then I recommend taking this course.

If you have a hard time staying caught up on reading, maybe don't take this class with other reading intensive courses.  But I highly recommend this class! It is very eye-opening.  Especially if you are an econ major or sciency person, take one or two classes outside the box.

Amazing course. I enrolled in the class not really knowing what to expect and the course was definitely my favorite of this term. Although it may seem heavy on reading (some nights can be ~60pgs per class) the material is very interesting and mind-opening. The class was taught on a discussion based form with Prof A'ness acting as an equal when sharing ideas, yet also encouraging comments when the class was quieter. Grades were based on journal entries per night of reading, a media file, a forum theater skit, a final paper, attendance and class participation. No tests were given. In this department, few professors are purely womens & gender studies professors. Professors from other departments teach classes within this department who have an adequate background of the topic but can bring a different twist and point of view to each separate section. I can comment on my experience of having a class with Professor A'ness, but cannot assure you that all wgst-10 course experiences will be identical to mine. Prof A'ness was extremely energetic, funny, and understanding. Take the class (yes, even if you're a guy).

This is one of the best classes offered at Dartmouth. It explores important issues of race, gender, sexuality and other forms of identity.

Professor A'Ness is great! She doesn't lecture  but facilitates discussions and she always helps the class understand the material by relating theory and experience. She incorporates theater exercises and performance into the class, which is not only interactive and fun but also gives us a taste of real life activism. There's a fair amount of writing involved but nothing too difficult. Journal entries/short essays are required for one reading of choice per class. There's a media file and lastly a final paper. Median for the class was A-. I definitely loved this class and I would recommend it to anyone else!

I honestly still have no idea what to make of this class. While I found Professor Fluri to be interesting, intelligent, and compassionate outside of class, within class she seemed more interested in pushing a liberal agenda than fostering true discussion. Moreover, I never was quite sure what it was I was supposed to be learning--the readings seemed to disparate to lend themselves to anything cohesive; the only thing I really took away was that a feminist could be anyone--a housewife, a career woman, someone who was pro-choice, someone that was pro-life--that the word meant so many things it basically meant nothing. I might recommend this class with a different professor, as again, I found Fluri to be very pushy (and also quite scattered) in class. However, if you are interested in women's issues, I might recommend you talk to her in office hours--she is very knowledgeable, and seems more relaxed when not in a classroom environment.
@
Jennifer Fluri
/course/2946
It really depends on the people in the class.  The class is discussion-based, and the focus is on readings we've done outside of class.  There is a TON of reading throughout the beginning of the course.  However, it is more time-consuming than difficult.  We usually got off the topic during class and ended up discussing something totally irrelevant and often pretty interesting.  The projects are a little risky...You are assigned a group with which you work on several time-consuming, but possibly fun, projects.  So, just hope that the group dynamic works.  To reiterate, the projects, one of which is a movie, take hours and hours and hours.   Jennifer Fluri really doesn't do much.  Well, she does constantly bring up her research--even if it is irrelevant.

She definitely exposes you to a view other than the typical white wealthy woman of the first wave.  However, it was sometimes difficult for Fluri to bring the discussion past a confessional of complaints here at dartmouth as this is an introductory course.

This class was awful.  Professor Fluri is an intelligent woman, but incredibly narrow minded and only responded (both in class and in her grading) to ideas that paralleled her own.  She was disrespectful to students who voiced original opinions.  And, almost more insultingly, her TA (an '06) did nearly half the grading for a class of 14 students and spoke in class ten times as frequently as any of the undergraduates.    I would strongly, strongly advise not taking classes with Professor Fluri unless you are willing to go along with her views.

This class was amazing. Everyone should take it before they graduate. I think it really depends on the people that you have in the class because it is very discussion based, so people's opinions and how much they contribute to class affects the feel of everything. Prof Fluri speaks in class, but mostly serves as a facilitator during discussions. In general, she's really nice and really a great person to talk to. The only thing is that there is something major (paper/(group and individual) project) due approx. once a week and usually a daily reading homework assignment due, so there is definitely work to do in this class. But, overall you'll do well as long as you do the work.

the projects were fun. it really depends on the people you end up with though, you pretty much get stuck with them for the rest of the term.  the reading summary can be tedious, but generally the workload isn't that much, apart from the 2 papers that you have to write.   Professor Fluri is really approachable and helpful, and i like her a lot.  But this class is based strongly on discussions, so if you are looking for a lecture class, this is not for you.

I was really excited to take this course because I wanted to learn a lot more about the topic. For the most part, I was disappointed.  The weakest part about this class was it's design. The first week involved lots of reading. We moved through the reading so quickly that we didn't really have time to digest it and discuss it. Also, the way discussion was run was frustrating because there were too many people in the class. Professor Fluri responded to each individual comment rather than allowing conversation to flor or guiding it in a certain direction. In result, the quality of class very much depended on the people in the class, which is worth keeping in mind. Next, we had multiple projects going at once, which got really confusing. Professor Fluri mentioned them once, and never brought them up again, even before the due date (so make sure to check the syllabus regularly!). Then we started having presentations every day and having to watch movies every night for class. Because these 3 segments were distinct rather than integrated, the work and class became very boring.  The issues covered in this class are really important, but I would recommend trying to take it with a different professor. Professor Fluri is very nice and really interesting to talk to at office hours, but she just seems unsure of how to run a class and I think a different professor could teach the material mroe effectively.

I LOOVED this class, dont listen to what anyone else tells you. Fluri is an awesome teacher who allowed us plenty of discussions and interesting homework, especially the ones that involved watching movies. I loved the group projects that allowed us to sort of take over the class. It's a perfect freshman fall class, i think.

So, this class was easy in terms of final grades and project grades. The course readings varied from very tough to easy reads, yet fully comprehending them was not necessary to do well in the class - it was easy to fake and (despite what she claims) she can't tell from our papers if we have done the readings.   Our papers are opinion based and supposed to included lots of 'i thinks' which made it all feel very unscientific and not even good writing or accepted in academia. And the projects -- dressing up as female super heroines or keeping daily media journals - makes me feel like i am back in 5th grade (but they were graded easily and there is extra credit).  Our class consisted almost entirely of discussions; rarely did we get a lecture or clearly guided path or topic. There were some interesting debates but often i felt that class boarded too much on ranting against popular society and the male gender (almost the whole class was female).   I did not learn much and almost nothing useful but thought provoking topics were raised.  Professor Fluri was an easy professor and did not have clear lectures or a direction for the class (except to turn against popular culture) but she was one of the nicest and most flexible professors ever -- if we were stressed she would easily give us an extension. She is really very nice and she does care.

Prof. Katz is very flexible and understanding. She directs class discussions with ease and keeps things interesting. I would reccommend her to anyone looking to take WGST 10. She doesn't demand too much from you, yet she still keeps you working at a steady pace. The readings are usually quite interesting and informatve, and I can personally amdit that this class has changed several of the opinions which I had previosly and ignorantly held. It was the highlight of my fall term classes... and I'm glad that I didn't listen to all of the negative reviews which I encountered on SAguide about Katz!!!!! Don't believe it guys!

I went into this class expecting to be totally enthralled and inspired by the material. Instead, the heavy workload made the class less stimulating than I had desired; I didn’t have enough time to digest the material and formulate my own questions and opinions. I do feel that I learned about sex, gender and their role in society, but my expectations weren’t met. Professor Katz, is a very nice woman but her ability to direct conversation is lacking. I recommend the class to people but not whole-heartedly.

The professor did not provide any lectures and her knowledge of the subject was minimal.  She did not provide the class with many thought-provoking questions.  The readings overlapped greatly and the assignemts were a lot of busy work.

I really liked the reading.  Some of it was repetitive, but for the most part, it was interesting and engaging.  Professor Katz didn't really inspire the class though.  There are journal entries for every reading assignment where, along with analyzing, you are expected to thoroughly summarize the reading.  It is really annoying and a waste of time.

I came into Dartmouth thinking about majoring in Women and Gender studies, so I took this course as a general overview and to make sure I knew what I was getting myself into.  I think this was Prof. Katz's first term to teach the course, and so she was experimenting with different ways to approach the subject matter (she was very avaliable after class and open to suggestions on how to change her teaching style to be more effective).  What I will remember most about this course was the sheer mountain of reading required for this course.  I have never been so happy as the day I turned the last page on the 575+ page course reader.  Two or three articles are requierd for each class, with a journal entry on each (nearly everone had trouble with the journals.  Lord help you if you fall behind on them).  Though some of the articles were of a more manigable length, just as many were like miniature novels  They covered a wide range of perspectives and issues on gender issues, and though interesting, the sheer number of them made it easy to forget most of what we'd learned.

I enjoyed this class mostly because it was based in discussion, and it was interesting to hear what others had to say on the touchy issues that we covered.  There was a lot of work associated with the course- journal entries galore, projects, the paper, etc. Not having any tests was nice, and I never really felt much pressure. As long as you keep up with the work, it's not a problem at all. Katz was really open to changing around her syllabus and was always looking for our input. As a freshman, I found her somewhat intimidating and critical, and I know others were perturbed at her closed minded opinions. Other than that, she was fine and let our class run itself.
@
Phyllis Katz
/course/2946
The course is awesome, I recommend it to anyone.  However, take it with a different prof.  Prof Katz didn't really add anything to the course.  I learned more from the other students, and Katz often ran discussions by picking on people to speak rather than letting it be more of a flowing dialogue in the classroom.  Thus discussions were often stilted and disjointed, something that could have easily been avoided in a seminar-type format.

Prof. Orleck is a very good teacher. Unheard of for a WGST class, this class was half female and half male. The conversations were very good and the whole class was engaged. The only bad part is that some of the readings were very boring (but the conversations that followed them were good!).
@

/course/2946
I kind of feel like Prof. Orleck was a lazy professor.  The class was all discussion pretty much but she would take control of the discussion whenever she wanted to say something.  Our entire grade seems to be a attendance, paper, journal entries, and a self-evaluation.  It just seems kind of sparse.  I just felt like Professor Orleck didn't really feel like teaching.  I understand that maybe discussion was a great way to dialogue about these issues, but it was weird to be always discussing.  I don't know, I went into this class with high hopes and feel a little disappointed.

i was really pleased with my personal growth as a result of this class.  it's changed the way i view the world and the way i interact with people.  professor orleck was great and was really responsive to opinions in class, as well as problems i had outside of class.  i looked forward to this class every day.  the readings weren't too hard and they were mostly all interesting.  our class discussions ranged from pretty interesting to very fulfilling.  students are encouraged to connect personal experiences with the readings we do, and some great class discussions centered around masculinity, greek life, and if prostitution can ever be a choice.  the class is mainly graded on attendance, participation, daily journal entries, and a final 12-15 page paper.  the only downside is that you have no idea what your grade in the class is until the very end.  this class isn't too much work, and it's very fulfilling.  if you can fit it into your schedule and are interested, you should definitely take it.

This class is very heavy on reading - several articles a night, and you're supposed to write an entry each night in a journal due at the end - I ended up writing all the entries for the week on sunday. No other written work beside the research paper (15 pages) due at the end - topic of choice, can do interviews and such. Most of the reading is very interesting and deals with hot topics - racism, homosexuality, gender, class, environmental issues, etc. Class is discussion-based, with student discussion leaders. The prof. usually just interjects, only 1 or 2 real lectures. A few guest speakers. Definately a good course, and one that opens your mind up to a lot of important issues.

This is a terrible course if you are no a man-hater... there is very little work, which is why I took it, but every guy in the class was ostracized and given a poor grade because he didn't buy into things like "there are 5 genders" or "every woman exists somewhere on the lesbian continuum."  Orleck is awful, though if you have an NRO (luckily I did), you could use it here and not work very much

if i could design my own educations as i wished, i would make all my classes like wst 10 w/ prof orleck.  the format (readings for homework, personal journal responsed, and discussions in class) is extremely effective. we also watched some powerful films.   this class was all about EXPOSURE and if you're not too scared, then go for it- you will learn so much about yourself, your peers, and your world in general.   and no, it's not all about feminism at all (in fact we probably only directly talked about that for part of one day). really it's about people all around the world. we ask questions like "what is gender" and are there sex-differences (inherent or socialized) and what are the implications. we also talk about economic inequality.  there is no question that you will grow from this class and this professor.

I really enjoyed this course a lot.  The majority of the classes were discussion oriented. It was refreshing after a long powerpoint lecture.  This class led me to reevaluate the way I look at the world. The subject matter is really interesting.  Discussion topics include  poverty and gender, female circumcision, defining masculinity, the greek system, prostitution,the media and how it affects images of women and men, mothers and the making of martyrs,etc. It was a nice blend of international and domestic topics.   There are no tests, no reading quizzes -you can get away with not doing the reading assigment for a night.  There is a 15-20 page research paper at the end of the course.   Professor Orleck makes herself available to help you with your paper.  I met with her multiple times during office hours and it was extremely helpful.  There is a journal assignment that lasts throughout the term.  In the journal you write responses to readings, discussions, and include articles and images that pertain to the reading.  The journal is due at the end of the term.  Would suggest not waiting till the end to do all the entries like I did. Not so good.  Annelise Orleck is an excellent prof.  She definitely made the course.  Never forced her opinions on anyone in the class.  She basically mediated the discussion and redirected the class back to the topic if we digressed. She's very understanding when it comes to extensions and such.  I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Contrary to popular belief there are guys who take this course too.  There were about 5 out of 27 or so in my class. I was really suprised at the composition of the class.  I expected a group of psycho-femmes, but realistically everyone kept the discussions civil and there was no guy-bashing.  The only thing I don't like about the class is that you have no idea what grade you are getting since everything is due at the end of the term. Oh, participation counts too. Personally, I think this is a course everyone should take.

I was highly impressed by both the course and the professor in womens studies 10 this fall. I always looked forward to attending class, and the class discussions (which we had almost everyday) were for the most part very engaging. Basically, i never felt like putting my head down on my desk.   I also want to stress that there was no "man-hating" going on. Although i'm a woman, the men in the class said the same thing at the end of the term.   So, i highly recommend the class. It's not hard or time-consuming, and as long as you come prepared to say something worthwhile you'll do well.

Women's studies 10 is incredibly interesting and certainly worth taking, regardless of major. The class had great discussions and prof. kacandes inspired interested without much lecturing. There was, however, an exorbitant amout of reading. i mean really ridiculous. Be prepared to invest a lot of time not only in the extensive readings, but also in the required notes that accompany. All in all, worth the time, but sometimes tedious.

This course was a really good introduction to the issues and topics that Women's Studies examines.  It is a lot of reading, and the required reading notes take a LOT of time....expeically if you get behind.  And they are required to be in a pretty specific format.  The material, for the most part, is very informative and interesting. I've heard great things about this class.  I would recommend that everyone take it, perhaps with a different prof. though.  The professor DEFINITELY makes or breaks the course.   Professor Kacandes is extremely knowledgable, but sometimes is a bit too controlling over class discussions.  I also got the sense that she was already familiar with any of the comments that were made in class.

Everyone should take this class.  This issues are so relevant to anyone's life.  This course is NOT just for women!!!  There was a ton of reading and a fair amount of work, but it was all manageable, and there was no final paper or exam, which helped a lot.  The seminar structure of the class also made it one of my favorites.  We had some amazing discussions, and Kacandes didn't lecture very much.  When she did, it was very helpful, i.e. it provided history of an issue that wasn't in the reading.  This isn't an easy class, but it is worth taking because it addresses issues that you will deal with every day.

Taking Women's Studies 10 under Professor Kacandes was an awesome experience because it didn't always feel so much like a class but rather a discussion group where we dealth with material as though it were (and sometimes it really way) issues that apply to us.  Between the professor and our TA Shilyh Warren, there was always someone to talk to further.  It became a very personal learning experience and I changed as a person as well as a student.  I recommend you take this class.

Did I know what I was getting myself into when I signed up for this class?  Heck no!  I'd heard from all kinds of people that it was phenomenal and one of the best classes at Dartmouth to take, and they were right!  While more than a typical work course, it was worth it.  There's a LOT of reading and you really do have to do it all because you have to do reading notes for grades.  And DO NOT leave these until the night before one of the due dates or you'll be up the river...they take a while and actually do help with class discussions so keep up with them!  Group projects are no sweat and are usually pretty interesting.  It's a fun experience also to write a paper with other people...you really get to know them well and you become closer with everyone in the class (about 20 people) through the discussions and class activities.  The individual research paper is fun if you do it on something that interests you.  Have a good time with it because it'll show in the final product.  Kacandes was great, although it seemed she was a bit distant from us at times.  She offered wonderful insight and helped discussion along often.  We had an awesome TA who made the class even more awesome.  It'll seem crazy at the end of the term when you're turning things in left and right, but the end product is worth it.  The readings will come in handy during late night discussions with friends at 2 in the morning.  The things you talk about in this class ACTUALLY come up in natural conversation and it's amazing to be able to put in all these different ideas and published viewpoints, as well as your own developed viewpoint.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CLASS!  Take it!  You won't be sorry.  And even if you're the only guy, there's nothing to lose.  You won't be put in the corner or have your ideas discounted.  I was one of four guys in my class and they valued my input a lot because I was obviously in the minority in the class, able to give a lot of insight that the rest of the class didn't have.  This class should be required...that's how strongly I believe in it.  Take it!  )

This class was a good survey of all the problems there is in the world concerning race, class, and gender.  I thought this class was going to be mostly about women, but we covered the three topics pretty evenly.  The first part of the class was kinda boring, you just learn about the history of feminism and biology.  But things soon heated up when we got to race and gender stuff.  The class format is small (like 20 something students) and we mostly discuss the readings.  In discussion, other people's opinions come out and it was just really intresting to see what other people thought about the subject.  Kacandes is a really nice prof.  She's really open to new ideas, and likes to make sure that the class is learning.  So if you need an SOC distrib, take this one.  The homework is really easy too.

Lots of people take this class for the CI, but I can't speak from that perspective.  I will say however, that I was worried about the amount of focus on current media at first.  It turned out to be a great experience learning to write about news media and films using the analytical tools of W&G Studies.  Prof Bronski is really cool, and talking with him is always very interesting and thought-provoking.  Our unusually large class did require a TA, probably a first for the WGST department, and he had very high standards, but helped me improve my writing when I felt like I didn't know what he expected from the weekly assignment.  Plus, the prof gives the grades in the end, so there's no need to worry that the TA's letter grades won't reflect your effort and progress.

Prof Bronski knows what he is talking about, and manages to make the material really engaging, even for people not so interested in WGST. this class is an easy A if you just complete the work. bronski pulls material from all different areas, including old film clips, cartoons, current news, feminist thought, and even non feminist though. really wide variety of information which makes for a better more general understanding of the topic. Easy and fun, take it.

The class was definately interesting. It opened my eyes to things I'd never considered. The readings were a bit tedious and the papers were just unfair. I don't see how she could have expected us to do well on them considering we barely had time to discuss the material. Overall it's a great class, the papers are kind of riduclous though.
@
Faith Beasley
/course/2946
This class was not at all what I expected. While it was supposed to be discussion based, it always seemed to turn into one student making a comment and then Beasley talking about that comment for nearly the rest of class. I also thought a class in this department would be one open to varying opinions, but that was certainly not true. Beasley would hardly even acknowledge differing opinions in class or in assignments. The material we covered in class was also suspiciously correlated with what Beasley herself considered important - for example, French and Indian feminism, because she is a French professor and her husband is from India. I can honestly say I learned more about Beasley's personal life than I did about sex, gender, or society.  Nearly half of our grade in this class was comprised of two essays. The grades for these essays seemed completely arbitrary and based only on how closely your argument matched what Beasley personally believed about the texts. When I tried to visit her during office hours to get feedback on drafts, she would conveniently be unavailable until the afternoon before the due date.  Please do not take this course with Beasley. I have heard nothing but great things about WGST10 taught by Fluri. I really wish I had been able to take her class, but I had a scheduling conflict with her section. I completely regret taking this course as it was a waste of my time. The entire thing is a joke but because of the grading, your GPA could take a dive as a result. If you are just looking to fulfill your CI distributive, please look elsewhere and avoid Beasley if at all possible.

I took this to fulfill my distribs and it was ok. A reading response was due every class and that was a little annoying. Also there were 2 papers about 5 pages each but they weren't graded very fairly. If you want an ok grade just to get a distrib out of the way this is a good choice.

This course is supposed to be one of those life-changing ones.  Everyone I spoke with who had taken it raved about how wonderful it was, how it changed their worldviews.  They also cautioned, every single one of them, that it really made a difference who the professor is.  And it does.    Professor Swain means well.  Really, she does.  She is a fairly ineffective discussion leader, however, and she wanted the class to be discussion all the time.  Frequently the class turned into a "men do the darndest things" episode.    We had journal assignments for each article-- and she asked so much from each article that I for one resented her and refused to discuss things in class.  The journal entries were the biggest pain -- requiring hours of preparation for every class.

I was a little unsure about taking a women's studies class, because people think that women's studies classes are 'fake' or that you have to be a wild liberal feminist to be in such a class. However, neither of these ideas turned out to be true. There were women AND men in my class, and in past classes, the numbers were 50-50. Although some of the issues are women-focused, they could be broadly applied.  There were also readings about class and race divisions, and men and masculinity. This class covered a broad spectrum and was, for the most part, very interesting. There were no lectures; the class was discussion based and Prof. Swain tried different methods, such as having student-led discussions. I would highly recommend this class to anyone, any grade, man or woman. It's a great overall introduction to the topics of Gender studies.
@
Virginia E.
/course/2946
This is one of those "must take before graduation" courses that should be mandatory for everyone. You'll discuss relevant issues to your daily life--i.e. the Greek system at Dartmouth, how women and men are portrayed in the media (on TV/movies/magazines/ads), intersections of race/class/gender, etc. It was definitely eye opening for many people in the class who hadn't ever considered such things before.  The readings are great--stuff that you'll actually want to read. For the non-major, this class definitely isn't rooted in theory, and is more a class on gender roles in the everyday world. Both men and women take this class, and it's one of the department's prides.   However, I don't think Prof. Swain had taught this class before, so she really didn't do that great of a job leading sessions. She had students lead discussions for just about every class, so she actually didn't do that much. Most of the time, she just sat back and let the students do all the talking. Her expertise is French women, so she talked a little bit about that, but other than that, students ran the class.  Her assignments were also unreasonable, but I don't think she realized that until the class brought it up halfway through the course. She made us do journal entries for each of the readings (there were probably 2-3 articles a day), which was ridiculous, and of course, everyone saved them for the day before they were due. But after we complained, she changed it, so at least she was accomodating.   She's a perfectly nice person and easy to talk to, but just wasn't the best professor to take this class with. So, strong recs for the course--definitely take it--but not so much for the prof.

Professor Swain is a nice enough individual, but her unwillingness to let you interject your own opinions and the five minutes she gives you to discuss 100 pages of reading is frustrating.  Take this class.  DO NOT take it from Prof. Swain.

Bergland is an awesome professor. Like the review from 11F, you read the readings, go to class, lecture, and then discuss. You might have to do some informal presentations but they're literally no big deal. Also when she says bring your copy of your book to class, bring it! Yes, there's a lot of readings, but you can get away with reading one or two. Be sure to keep up with your lexicons; she's lax on due dates, but you'll get behind if you keep procrastinating. Also, just a fun, chill class to be in and Bergland is so quirky yet funny.

Overall a great and easygoing class. There are a lot of readings which you should try and keep up with, but you can get away without reading all of them. The structure of the class is pretty simple do the readings, go to class, discuss them. There is a lax assignment due every Monday and Bergland is really chill with deadlines, but definitely try to keep up with the assignments or you'll have a lot of work piled up at the end of the quarter. Professor Bergland is a wonderful, chill, and quirky professor and I really enjoyed her class. Do as many readings as you can and try to keep up with the assignments. If you can come to class prepared with at least one or two comments you'll be golden.

This class is pretty straight forward do the readings, go to class, participate in discussion, then go home and do more readings.  Structure of the class she lectures on the material you should have read for homework, then you kind of discuss it in class. Discussion will all depend on how much people participate and who actually does the reading. My class was fairly large for discussion so at times we would come to an awkard pause.   You can get by through discussion not doing some of the readings but you'll need them for your papers.   You're graded on participation, a 6-8 page mid-term paper, a group presentation (on the topic of your choosing that relates to the class), and a 6-8 Final paper.  She gives you the prompt for both papers but is pretty flexible about your group presentation as long as you relate it back to what you learned in class.   Also, she is very helpful during office hours and very approachable. I went to office hours to have her review my papers before submitting them and she was more than glad to help me with that.   Overall a fairly straightforward easy third class and who knows maybe some of the material will be interesting to you.

This was a great intro class, very wide variety of readings and they were all really interesting. Professor Rabig is SUPER knowledgable about the topics and everything that is assigned. The only negative I found in this class is that most people did not take the class because they were interested, so they made no effort to learn from the material and actively participate. This made class discussions very difficult. If more people spoke, it would have been more enjoyable. I would highly recommend this class if you are interested in the subject and want to learn a lot about it! I think it can be very educational for all.

Ana Merino is a terrible professor.  The worst I have had at Dartmouth, no comparison.  How she got a job is beyond me.  She gives wildly rambling lectures that leave you wondering what her plan for the day was, routinely interrupts students when they speak (especially, perhaps only, when their views disagree with hers), marginalizes the opinions of any student who is not extremely liberal (or willing to fake it), and also has such a poor command of the English language that she frequently asks students how to spell a word, pronounce it, or for a clarification of meaning.  She requires classroom participation and weighs it heavily in her grading metric, yet her attitude discourages certain people in the class from speaking...especially men, and especially men in fraternities - she doesn't hide the fact that she is against them.  She is also selfish, requiring students to go to talks where she is introducing the speaker, even when the talk is about Asian Comics and is only tenuously related, at best, to sex, gender, and society.  The English thing gets me especially, because the course is a lot of writing.  All told, I'm going to end up turning in 60-70 written pages of my work, to be graded by someone who has a sub-standard understanding of the language.  Am I the only one who is somewhat uncomforted by that?  On top of that, we're now in finals period and I have no idea what kind of grade I could end up getting - I've turned in several things, but they come back to me with comments like "very good" or "good writing" with no notion of a grade attached.    Don't ever take a class with Ana Merino, unless it is a Spanish class - I suppose she may be a good professor in that department.  But if she teaches WGST 10 again, steer clear.  I've heard from friends that this can be a great class, but with Ana Merino it certainly was not.

a note on prof merino - gave more homework than anyone expected from an intro and summer course.  more work than my "serious" courses this summer.  readings + 2-page journals for each reading - for each class.  friends who have taken the class in the past said it was more relaxed for them.   on the other hand, she has a lot of interesting stories and is definitely passionate about the subject.

This is a great discussion-based class. It really makes you think about what you believe in concerning the subject and lets you express your ideas. The professor helps facilitate the discussion and is also very understanding. Just make sure you keep up with the reading and work.It's a lot of work, but I thought it was worth it.It's also pretty nice that the professor mixed up the reading assignments with comics and movies.
@
Ana Merino
/course/2946
The class would have been much better were it not for the 500 words we had to write on every one of our 25 readings and 8 films, in addition to a media file and paper.  In addition, Ana Merino's difficulty with English was a huge problem.  From what I've heard, she's a fantastic prof in Spanish...

I loved this course and the professor even though I only took it to fill a credit and wouldn't normally have chosen a WGST course. The course readings were diverse and showed all points of view and topics within the scope of the course.  Lots of discussion so attendance is important but work outside of class is not difficult unless you don't keep up with the reading.  Professor was great at starting discussion but not controlling the direction of topic.  Hard to know what your grade is throughout the term b/c a lot is based on disscussion and one group presentation.

This was one of the best courses that I've taken at Dartmouth!  Professor Tarnowski selected excellent readings and I always looked forward to attending this course because the discussions were so good.  It really made me wish that I had discovered the WGST department earlier on in my Dartmouth career.  I'd definitely recommend that everyone take WGST 10, even if it's not with Tarnowski.

This class has virtually no structure. It is super easy the first 5 weeks with almost zero work. However, there are a lot of projects and write-ups in the second half. Also, you get no real grades throughout the term so it is very hard to know how you are doing. Reading is not necessary, and the class is almost all discussions of your own ideas. Participation requirement is minimal. The class is not that hard, but attendance is checked and part of the grade. Limited x-hours, but a lot of required events outside of class. Also, the conversations can be very slanted and sometimes very boring. Giavanna is very nice and fluid with deadlines. Very interesting, but I will probably not be taking another class in this subject.
@
Giavanna Munafo
/course/2946
Overall great class. Prof Munafo is extremely cool (and woke) as well as flexible and understanding. Class is mainly discussion based, which is either super interesting or boring depending on the topic/paper being discussed. Can get by with little to no work (readings are unnecessary) most of the term, but end of term has a few more assignments including projects and papers (not very hard either). I would greatly recommend this class to anyone at Dartmouth because it is easy, minimal workload, and impactful--giving you a fresh new perspective on WGSS issues and fostering discussion outside the classroom.
@
Giavanna Munafo
/course/2946
One of my favorite classes at Dartmouth. Prof Munafo is very flexible with timelines and making sure the curriculum includes topics that the students are interested in. During my term she had the seniors be the "class leaders" and essentially they were representatives for the students that Munafo would go to for advice on how the class was going and whether to move deadlines. I thought the discussions were really enlightening, which was also because my peers were very engaged as well and Munafo provided a good way to guide the discussion. On the other hand, class was slightly confusing because deadlines/etc. were constantly changing but overall I would recommend the course to anyone who's interested in taking the class.

If this had been my introduction to the WGST department, there is no way I'd have become a major. None of the other classes I have taken assign readings that advocate violence against a group of people as a resolution to tension, nor do they so continuously blame men as the source of evil in society.  Rumor has it that this class can be great, but only in the fall apparently. I'd recomend Katz or A'Ness. Beware of anyone else, though.

I do not take humanities classes by a rule, but took wgst 10 for fun and ended up learning a lot.  There's a lot of very complex gender theory that Rosenthal didn't really explain very well, and she didn't really teach anything (every class was just a discussion of the reading, which piles up if you don't stay on top of it) but the discussions really made me think and by the end of the term I am really happy that I chose to take it.  I would definitely take this course if you want to try something new and want a completely new view of society.  Also too, don't be scared off by the title- we explored a lot of class/race issues as well, not just gender, and none of us were raging feminists.  There were even a few boys who came to class and taught the girls a lot by sharing their experiences.

I did not need to take this class but i am so happy that i did. It has been my favorite class so far. I found the prof interesting, class was a mixture of watching movies,lecture, and discussion. There was one oral presentation but it only was about five minutes so in reality it wasnt bad at all bc you do the presentations in groups.  The reading is facinating and if you are interested in education or psychology at all you will probably love this course!

Even though the professor was biased, the readings provided a rounded view of the issues we studied.

Good class with a great professor.  The professor of this course always changes term by term, but I would find when Professor Brison is teaching it next and pounce on it like a feminist on sexism.  The readings were great and interesting except for a couple.  Reading responses challenge you to consider what you have read, and the course is mostly discussion.  It is a great course even if you have never thought about gender issues before or always thought that WGST courses are just for feminist women.  They're not.
@
Douglas Moody
/course/2946
I don't usually say things like this, but, Prof. Moody is the worst prof I've had at Dartmouth.  After a term with him, I'm not sure he knows anything about WGST.  Basically every class discussion turned into 1) Feminists have an undeservedly bad reputation 2) A discussion of race or 3) Stereotypes are bad.  I actually learned the most from when my classmates would talk.  But often, Moody would interrupt the students with some random comment.  I'm sure he is a very nice person, but often his comments were even inappropriate.  The only thing I would say Moody was good at was Blackboard.  He is a pro at Blackboard, but that actually distracts.  He spent the first 20 min of every class for about the first 7 weeks puttering around Blackboard while we watched.  (Unfortunately, that's not an exaggeration).  And yet, the final week of the term, we had 2 group projects and 2-3 essays due.  Two group projects due within days of each other with different groups!  Ridiculous.  One was a video project in which 10% of your time is spent on content and the rest on making the project look pretty.  Also no one received a single grade or evaluation or paper back all term.

All the book were really interesting. However, it was the first time Prof Sprague taught this course and since she is usually a spanish prof sometimes the lectures and discussions dragged on to fill the time of the 10A. I learned a lot and really enjoyed all of the assignments.    -It was also a pretty bottom heavy course so just make sure you don't leave everything for the very end of the term

Okay, first day of class you find out there is an attendance policy (you can miss a combination of two drill/class lectures the entire term).  You see the syllabus, it looks daunting.   HOWEVER, I've taken spanish before.  I took Spanish 1 as a refresher and couldn't be happier.  Prof. Velez is this short Spanish woman who talks loud and pries into your personal life to help you make spanish stick.  I can honestly say that I should have been placed in spanish II or III but learned a ton in her class starting on day 1.   The homework for drill is annoying but everyday there is so much plain spanish interaction that the class really ends up being entertaining, so I highly recommend it.
@

This runs like you'd expect Span. 1 to run. As someone who has taken a few years of Spanish before, the pace of the class was still pretty quick, with new material presented every day. There is some book reading but nothing too difficult, just don't get behind in your prep. for class. Professor Velez was great, very energetic, available and helpful in office hours, and is the reason I could go to this class every morning of the week at 900.
@

Spanish 1 with Prof Velez was very dificult.  My tutor even told me she was the hardest out of the Spanish 1 profs.  She moves quickly and every mistake, such as missing accent marks and stuff, can completely destroy your test grade becasue EVERY mistake deducts major points.  I'm alot more prepared for spanish 2 but honestly I'd find an easier prof especially for new spanish teachers.  She is a nice though, very grandmotherly and sweet, but she bleives in taking this class seriously and doing the work necessary to be ready for class.
@

Very labor intensive - you've got to be ready each day because you will get called on in class and she will expect you to be prepared. Grading was 25 participation, 2 tests, 2 in class compositions, one individual presentation, and the final. And you have to have excellent attendance.

Prof Velez was awesome - she was always really enthusiastic and funny during classes (and I took a 9S) and you can tell she genuinely wants you to come out learning something. Also, if you find yourself struggling, don't wait to see her during office hours because she really cares a lot and will invest the time to help you if she sees you putting in the effort.  And as with all other language classes, it's best not to fall behind on the daily prep, because they move so fast that once you do it's difficult to catch up!

extremely fast paced if you have never taken spanish before.  It sucks because some people in the class have been studying spanish for 3-4 years and they wil make you feel really dumb, but the fact is there is an insane amount of new material every day, so it takes up a huge amount of time.   there were 3 kids who dropped the class, and I almost did too.   it seems like a really easy course for those who have spanish background though.  prof velez is very energetic, and tries to entertain us as much as possible.  Very helpful outside class, really responsive to blitz, willing to help you through . I heard she is a tough grader though, compared to other profs.  but u will definitely get a lot out of taking her class.

Professor Velez is very engaging and a lot of fun to talk to.  The only problem I found with the course was that it was not taught fully in Spanish as is the real Rassias method.  I went to her office hours every week to have conversations with her in Spanish to remedy this, however.  Overall the pacing of the course was relatively slow and VERY manageable.
@
Myrna Velez
/course/2833
If you have no experience in Spanish, I would not recommend taking this course. Most of the people in my class had at least a year, and I had to work my *** off to catch up. Getting a tutor was probably the only reason I passed. Spanish courses are very immersion based, and they don't do a lot of explicitly explaining the grammar. Which is how I learned my other language, Latin, so I was left kind of screwed over. My drill leader was extremely competent, but I heard otherwise from the other section.  The professor is fun, energetic, and very caring. She really wants to see her students succeed. That said, tests are hard, and she is a picky grader. I think she pulled though for me though, seeing as I got a full letter grade higher than expected.Class follows the book VERY CLOSELY, so read up and don't fall behind. This was my hardest class freshmen fall.  This class was a huge source of stress in my life. Not something you necessarily want freshmen fall--wait to take. You might want to brush up over summer before taking if you don't have experience-it is that hard. Be careful, and NRO if you can!

If you've decided to take Spanish, Prof. Velez will do a great job of teaching it. She cares so much about the students in her class and will make sure that any problems you are having can be quickly solved, be they academic or otherwise. I blitzed her when I was sick one time and she sent a very caring message back and helped me catch up on the work that I missed. She is very enthusiastic in class and will work very hard to help you learn the material.

If you want to learn Spanish well, take it with Professor Velez. She is extremely organized and is always in total control of the class. She calls upon you during classes which challenges you to practice speaking in Spanish no matter how bad you are. She is very concerned about your progress and regularly checks with you to see how you feel about the course. Her no-English policy is also strictly enforced, so you really get a chance to practice your Spanish in class.   Even though I had learnt most of the material in Spanish 1 before, I still found it interesting and challenging with Velez. It was only after I had another teacher this term that I realised how much Velez had helped me with my Spanish. Take it with her if you can!

This is your typical Spanish 1 class, I think.

Professor Velez is very nice and extremely outgoing!  A surprise from some regular profs at Dartmouth.  She will make you feel comfortable right away by getting in your face, smiling, and saying !hola! (hello)  However, over time I found her to be annoying.  She takes the course VERY seriously (mainly because she always gets crap from her department) and wants everyone to speak in Spanish. If you miss more than 1 drill and 1 class you are in trouble and she will send you a blitz letting you know.  Don't talk in English after the 4th or 5th week or she will send you a blitz letting you know how disappointed she is in you.  Exams are ridiculously difficult (but it's the same exam for all sections) because she focuses on oral speaking while the exam is written -- a very stupid system to me (but that's the department setup, not Velez's).  I say "eh" if you want to take spanish 1 with her.

This course is a lot of fun and you actually get to learn quite a bit of Spanish. I liked the fact that the emphasis was on conversation, because grammar was not particularly hard. However, there were people who'd never studied a language before, and I don't think that the "study grammar by yourself" strategy was the easiest for them. But you can always ask Profesora Velez about the things you don't understand, and she will gladly explain them to you.  I think the most important advantage of this course was the teacher. Myrna Velez is an exceptional person and an experienced educator, and has a passion for her job that you could rarely see nowadays. It's indicative that this was a morning class, but after 10 minutes or so everyone was awake and ready to participate. Velez would make you feel really good if you do well - even if you've simply constructed the right sentence during class discussion. But don't be fooled - she has really high expectations and could get really annoyed if you come unprepared for class. As a whole, the class is a lot of work and it's not very smart to combine it with other time-taking or heavy reading classes (unless you're sort of a genius, as were some of the people in my class).  In short - the more you give Spanish 1, the more you'll get back. And you'll have tons of fun!

This class was interesting because some kids in it had taken Spanish before, and others had absolutely no Spanish experience (like me). It was definitely hard for those of us with no Spanish experience... the first few weeks of the course, my life equaled Spanish. However, though the course moves insanely fast, by midway through the work was manageable. Prof. Velez is really great about helping people out who seek help. Sometimes she speaks very fast in class and is hard to understand, but if you ask her to slow down she will. She definitely cares about individual students in the class, and helps you be optimistic. If you are taking this class, definitely try to take it with Velez! She's funny and a very dynamic lecturer, which makes it interesting - no one ever fell asleep in our class. I was dreading taking a language here, but I needed to fulfill my language requirement... after taking this class, I want to continue with Spanish, and take more languages!

I was talking Spanish 1 my senior spring to prepare for volunteer work in Central America so I'm really glad I had Professor Velez who puts a lot in and demands a lot out of her Spanish 1 class.  This class needs a LOT of time -- just to let the material absorb.  You have one day to learn most vocab, there's no spacing it out.  But it's an organized course with a good book and good drill instructors so if you need to learn spanish, this is a good place to start.  Also, I did afternoon drill and was happier for it.

It was definitely hard to get through this class knowing that it wasn't required for me.  Having Spanish 1 everyday of the week (plus drill four times/week) is exhausting, and by the end of the term, I was more than ready to be done with the course.  However, Prof Velez is among the most dynamic people you will meet in your lifetime and will get everyone going even early in the morning - which is quite an accomplishment.  The course is paced far too quickly, and I can't say that I necessarily truly know so much Spanish after it, but that is not her fault, and she does the best she can in a measly ten weeks.  Overall, a great course although paced too quickly - but make sure you're ready for the commitment!

Aside from drill and doing the workbook, I didn't study more than a couple hours a week, but I had some Spanish before.    Velez forms opion about students fast, so make sure you come to class and participate, and you'll be fine.

Velez is awesome. She is passionate, energetic, and extremely dedicated to her students. Don't take this class if you aren't willing to dive in head first, because Velez has no patience for people that do not reciprocate her enthusiasm for learning.

The class itself was somewhat interesting, although not enough to cause me to consider majoring in Spanish. Prof. Velez made sure that we knew she was available for conferences outside of class, an absolute necessity considering the difficulty of the examinations, where Cs and Ds are not uncommon for people without prior familiarity with the language. You do learn a great deal in Prof. Velez's class, but if you are worried about your GPA I would recommend choosing a different teacher (some of the others allow notes on tests, etc.).

There is a lot of work.  You learn an amazing amount in 10 weeks. Becuase of that, the class is fast paced, hard and requires a lot of dedication.  With drill 5 timesa week, spanish 1 is mroe like two classes.    While the prof. has limited office hours, she's very good at blitz Q&A  Velez is fun, exciting and makes class interesting.

While the course was somewhat unfair in the sense that it consisted both of those who had spanish background (some with high school spanish as long as four years) and of those who have never or hardly been exposed to the language, I would strongly recommend anybody at Dartmouth to take Span 1.  Professor Velez is a perfect match for a language professor trying to interact with the students to the best of her ability, she almost always makes the class dynamic and active! Literally, most students are super attentive and it's nearly impossible to doze off in her class. She certainly cares about how much students learn and praise them when their exams grades improve.  She definitely motivated me to study Spanish and greatly stimulated my interest in it.   The class has five exams (four midterms and one final) and four in-class compositions. But they aren't that difficult or frustrating so long as you do not slack off.   Certainly a class one must consider taking at Dartmouth!!!!!

I totally recommend this class, especially because of the professor. Myrna Velez is the most energetic, funny and careful person I have met, really keeps you awake and smiling at 9am. Although the class is pretty quickly paced, Spanish 1 is definitely an easy class. the drill can get pretty annoying though ( morning one). You have one exam or composition every week, movies and homework, but Velez is extremely helpful in making the material comprehensible, interesting and fun!  This class is an experience you don't wanna miss!

Great Prof, really made coming to class (even though it was 5 days a week at 9am) fun.  i dont know how she stays so energetic all the time, but there was never a day when she wasnt excited to teach.  Only negative is that she can be a bit harsh on grading, but especially with compositions she will help you with grammar and review them for you if you show up to office hours.  Overall, great teacher!

If you've never taken spanish before, be prepared to have your term center around Spanish 1.  Drill and class take a larger chunck of time than you'd think, and your nights end alot earlier when you have morning drill.  Tests are difficult, and it's very tough to catch up if you fall a bit behind the curve.  However, Velez is extraordinary as a professor-willing to do just about anything to help you understand the huge amount of material that's covered in 10 weeks.  Just know what to expect, and know that you have an incredible resource in Prof. Velez.  She has a passion for this course like no other professor I've had, and she shares it readily with her students.

Professor Velez is a great professor; she's energetic and excited about the subject, and she speaks clearly and slowly enough so that any beginner will be able to get the jist of her lessons. If you put the work into this course, including lots of verb practice and review, then you'll do well and feel extremely prepared for spanish 2.

Myrna has to be one of the most positive and inspiring teachers Dartmouth has (to the point that at times she is a little crazy)    The class was very difficult for me, but that's because I'm not a language person.  I had to spend a lot of time outside of class studying in order to keep up, typically I would fall behind at the beginning of the unit and catch up right before the test.  I probably spent a lot more time working on Spanish that I mentioned, but frankly I can't remember.  Just try to put time in each day and memorize the vocab before hand and you will be fine.  And make sure you know where to put accents!!!   I thought the class was very effective in teaching students Spanish through immersion (no translating to English), but it was rather stressful for me because I would manage to make a fool of myself during class. It was great motivation for studying harder though.  You should definitely visit her during her office hours because those helped me a lot.

Profesora Velez gives excellent, energetic lectures. She truly has the students' best interests at heart and will do whatever it takes to help you understand Spanish. Her exams are slightly more challenging than what we practice in class, however, they are completely doable. She stresses writing skills so she grades a little tough on the compositions but her students then go to Spanish 2 and get As.
@
Myrna Velez
/course/2833
I took this class because I needed to fullfill my language requirement. I knew people in other sections with different profs who loved Begining Spanish and understood the material completely, and all I can say is avoid Velez if you're going to take this course. Velez is difficult to understand, doesn't answer your questions even during office hours, and I felt she never listened to me when I tried to explain what I didn't understand. I visited her during office hours on several occasions and every time I'd leave completely discouraged and feeling like an idiot. She will tell you to get a tutor, she will tell you you aren't studying hard enough, she will even suggest you have a learning disability, but she will not help you to understand the material. If you've never taken spanish before, don't take Spanish I with Velez, it was by far my worst experience with a prof at Dartmouth. This is the one class I really, really regret taking.
@
Myrna Velez
/course/2833
Velez is a very tough prof, but she makes you learn spanish. A fair amount of your grade is based on how much you participate in class, so don't just assume that becuase you do well on tests, you're doing well in the class. People have really disliked Velez, but if you take time to get to know her, and put effort into the class, she's really nice. Her main goal is to teach you spanish, although it would be pretty easy to contrue her differently. The tests nail you if you don't know the details, so it can be frusterating because even if you get the concept, you might not get a great grade. Overall, I liked the class though.

I enjoyed this class, but do not expect to get a good grade in it.  You can do well if you have a nack for languages or time to put into it.  The prof is wonerful and very enthusiastic, but the exams are tough.  I wouldn't recommend taking it in the Spring, if this is your first time taking Spanish, because the majority of the class consisted of people who had had 2 years of Spanish, were fluent in French, or were linguistics majors.  I had 2 years of Spanish before taking this and I still didn't do very well.

Prof Velez makes the course.  She's always energetic and loves her students and teaching -- which makes all the difference for a 9 a.m. Spanish class.  5 days a week of drill and class is rough, but we learned so much.  It's all Prof Velez that makes this Spanish 1 enjoyable.

Spanish 1 with Senora Velez was a good class overall.  She has a reputation for being for the hardest Spanish 1 professor, and while that is probably true, if you work hard you will do well.  It was a little intimidating in the beginning, but the course isn't paced too fast at all and the tests aren't bad either if you keep up on the material.  Daily preparation for class and drill is really helpful for understanding the grammar and vocab covered and only takes about 30 minutes to read the night before.  Senora Velez is always willing to help her students in and out of class if you have a question, and I would recommend seeing her if you have any questions; she loves her students and is really dedicated to helping them learn Spanish.  If you have to take this class or just want to learn Spanish, take it with her; you'll really enjoy the class and you'll get a great prof!

Sra. Velez is incredible.  She definitely inspired me to get out of bed in the morning and come to class.  Her classes were very engaging, and she never failed to be full of enthusiasm and spark.  She honestly cares about her students.  The tests were definitely more difficult than the HW and class work.  This was frustrating, and things popped up on the tests that we had breezed over.  I think this was a great prep for Spanish II, but a ton of work.
@
Myrna Velez
/course/2833
Sra Velez is a spaz.  I have no idea where she gets her energy from, but it remains high throughout the term.  Her obvious love of Spanish and love of teaching is inspiring.  This course is only 10 weeks long and I feel like I could carry on a fairly decent conversation in Spanish.  This class takes up a lot of time- drill and class every single day.  However, that's what it takes.  Velez is there to help you get through it.  Go to her office hours and make sure that she knows you.  She will (and wants to) help you with anything and everythign that you're struggling with.   The tests are hard.  I don't think that anyone ever got the grade that they wanted on a test.  However, it encourages you to work harder next time.  Your grades do slowly increase.  She also takes class participation into account to help improve the overall grades.    I highly recommend this course and this professor.
@

This is not meant to be insulting, but Velez is probably the worst prof I have ever had.  She is far more concerned with accents and spelling then she is with comprehension.  I knew other students in the class who would fail tests because of mispelled words, despite having right answers otherwise.  Class will not really help you learn spanish much better, as there is little interaction.  She also seems unable to answer even simple questions from students that are not directly related to what she is speaking about at that moment.  I have heard a few students who simply love her, but I can't imagine why.  She accused students who were not doing well in the class of having a learning disability.  I had been warned to not take her class, and wish I had listened.  This is my warning now then.  DO NOT TAKE A CLASS WITH VELEZ!!!  You will seriously regret it.  I am not trying to be mean, but she is simply a terrible teacher.  She will drain the life out of spanish, and make you hate it.  She will make it extremely difficult, to the point where you can speak and understand most everything she says, yet on tests get Ds because she doesn't care what you can understand, only accents and spelling.  AVOID VELEZ AT ALL COSTS!!!  I'm dead serious.

Professor Moody made the course very interesting and interactive.  He made sure students were keeping up with their studying by reviewing any new material.  I feel like I have a solid foundation to continue learning Spanish.  The course moved at a good pace so that there was little down time between having become comfortable with material and moving on to new material.  The readings and movie were interesting and fun. My one complaint is that the workbook homework is horribly boring because it is too easy and long.
@
Douglas Moody
/course/2833
I am a sophomore, this is my 5th term on campus, and Professor Moody is the most approachable, kind, and rational professor I have yet encountered at Dartmouth. If at all possible, take this course with him!!!  Homeworks are easy. A little bit of reading each night (never more than about 10 pages), and the way the book is designed, if you miss a couple days reading it is no big deal to catch back up.  The simple fact that drill is 5 days a week can be a pain, but in the end I have come to really appreciate them. Because classes are also 5 days a week, you really are forced to learn the material. All other intro language courses are the same though (except I hear Latin has no drills).   My drill instructor was a graduating senior, which translated into the best drills ever... unfortunately, this means you will not be able to have Michael Guzman as your drill instructor. Good luck with your drills!  I heard during the term that the other professor, Valez, was a real pain. I am sure if you read the reviews from the other class for this term, you will decide to go with Moody too!

Although the course requires a lot of outside time,  it is a fairly straight foraward course.

Spanish 1 is spanish 1.  All the sections follow the exact same syllabus and take the exact same tests.  The only real difference is the prof and I would say Moody is pretty good.  We did a lot of pair work which is good when learning a language, but some of his vocab drills were kind of boring.  From what I've heard about other profs, however, Moody is one of the better ones.  Try to get him if you can.

I really liked Professor Moody...although I kind of got sick of him by the end of the term.  He is extremely nice, very enthusiastic, and helps every student.  But he's almost too helpful.  By the eighth week I'm thinking "yeah, I get it already."  I dunno.  It's good, I liked it.  And I do know some Spanish now.

Professor Moody is a very outgoing and responsive prof.  He's entertaining and understanding and very reasonable about assignments and exams.  The exams aren't especially hard, but you do need to know the vocab.  The compositions are in class and are not difficult, and are graded very easily.  For someone who had had spanish before, this class was easy, a GPA booster.  For others, it may be more difficult, but the TAs and Prof are very responsive to that.  Morning drill is too early, but my instructor was fun and understanding, while still being professional, and the excercises did help to learn the material.  Just try to wakt up beforehand, it makes it easier.
@
Douglas Moody
/course/2833
If you haven't taken spanish (or you have forgotten a lot of what you took), take Spanish 1 with Prof. Moody. The first few classes will seem a little difficult because most students in the class will have taken some spanish before, but you will find that you catch up within a few weeks.  Most of the material the class covers is directly out of the book, so classes can be a bit dull. Given that they are only 50 minutes, this isn't really a problem.  Early in the course, Moody spoke in english most of the time to explain grammar and give definitions. This helped make it easier to follow what was happening for students who didnt have much experience with spanish. The problem was, he kept talking in english a lot even late in the term. I think this will make the transition to spanish 2 more difficult because I am not used to hearing grammar and sentence structure described in spanish. Moody also sometimes had trouble answering some grammar questions late in the term, perhaps because he himself is not a native spanish speaker.  Even with these faults, Moody is far better than Velez, the other option for spanish 1.
@
Douglas Moody
/course/2833
I attended all of the possible Spanish 1 sections to test out the different options for teachers and times.  Even though I liked an english class I wanted at the same time, I ended up in Moody's class cause he seemed like the nicest chillest prof of the options.  He's more flexible and understanding about attendance and assignments.  He's just generally nice and understanding even when he's telling you "no."  He's not a native speaker which has its advantages-- he's able to explain it better and not go so crazy fast that he loses everyone(which other teachers did on the first day)-- and its disadvantages-- sometimes he doesn't know the right word or has to think a while before answering a question about a grammatical detail.  Anyway, I'm happy with my decision and am happy with the way the term worked out.

Moody is a really relaxed and friendly teacher.  The class atmosphere is great, especially for a class that you have to be there 5 days a week for.  I had taken Spanish in high school and just needed to fill my language requirement, so this was a really easy class.  You do learn a lot though.  I would warn people who are taken Spanish for the first time because most people have taken Spanish before and you will be at a pretty big disadvantage.

i mean, spanish is spanish.  if you want to learn spanish, you have to take spanish one.  but be prepared to spend a LOT of time on mindless homework and exercises.  and drill.  and class every f'ing day.  its a lot of time for not a lot of depth in a course.  additionally, prof. moody is a great guy.  seriously.  but he speaks english half the time which makes it more difficult to learn the language and to speak it.
@

I came into Spanish 1 with a pretty entensive background in Spanish from high school.  I didn't know enough though to jump right into Spanish 2.  Moody is very easy and fun, but tends to be all over the place with his lectures.  This was fine for me, because I already knew most of the grammar, but had i come into this course not knowing any Spanish, I would have been totally lost.    While his teaching style isn't that great, he makes up for it with really easy grading.  Whenever he handed back tests, he would say things like "well, a lot of people made this mistake, but i didn't take off for it."  I got the impression that most people were doing pretty well in the course.  I have my doubts about how much Spanish Moody actually knows.  It was sort of an ongoing joke in our class that he only knew how to say "vamos empezar!" and "entonces!"  Most of the time he teaches in English, and when you ask him questions, he tends to have to stop to think about them for a while before answering.  Sometimes he can't even think of an answer, and will tell you that he'll "look into it."  Overall, Moody is really nice.  He's funny, and enjoys having fun in class.  If you really want TO LEARN a lot of Spanish, he might not be the right prof.  You might want someone who's a little stricter and who will push you harder, but if you're looking for an easy laid-back class, he's the prof for you!

Moody is entertaining and wants to get students involved, but usually does not speak much Spanish in class. In the beginning, that helped. But by the end, most people felt that, although they could read, write and understand Spanish pretty well, they couldn't speak it. Drill is a pain, but helps. The Spanish department is lively. Take this class if you need to fulfill a language requirement or want to learn the language.

Moody is the nicest professor I've met at Dartmouth.  That doesn't change the fact that this course can be a drag if you don't put in the work.  This class was a pleasant surprise for me.   By the way, if you're taking Spanish for the first time (like I did), be aware that you're going to have to put in overtime to do well, especially since everyone else in Spanish 1 will probably have two to four years of experience with Spanish (no joke).
@
Douglas Moody

Prof. Moody was the most sympathetic of the Spanish 1 profs that taught this term, from what my drillees said about theirs.  As a non-native speaker, he is more understanding of the problems of learning a language from scratch at age 20.  However, consider his non-nativeness if you're taking the course with plans for LSA or FSP.  I had a non-native prof and a non-native drill instructor, and when I met my boyfriend's native Spanish speaking family, it sounded like they were speaking a different language from the one I had been learning.  The speed and accent matter bigtime.  Otherwise, the class is fine.  You learn some Spanish; it's neither too tough nor too interesting.

I have heard stories about people really not liking Spanish 1 but with professor Moody you are guaranteed to like this course.  He is a good teacher and you learn a lot while in his class but he also so chill its unbelieveable.  As long as you show an interest in the class he will be fair with grades and respectful of your time.  He understands that Spanish 1 has a lot of in-class time and is, therefore, relatively understanding if you miss a couple of classes here and there.  (A quality which I have heard is not true with other Spanish 1 profs.)  As you can imagine, Spanish is not the most interesting of all subjects and there is a lot of memorizing to do.  But you'll definately have your best chance of enjoying the class if you take it from Douglas Moody.
@
Douglas Moody
/course/2833
After studying Latin for four years in high school, I entered the class completely foreign to Spanish. The new textbook they are using is great! In general, I found it relatively easy to pick up on the language, though I did spend a significant amount of time outside of class studying vocab and grammar. Tests were very fair, and all Spanish 1 students take the same tests, regardless of professor --- so things were pretty much taught right out of the book. Professor Moody is a great guy very friendly, extremely accessible, and has a good knowledge of Spanish grammar. Office hours were very helpful! One drawback to him, however, is that he is not a native speaker and simply "picked up" the language while living in Spain. So I would not classify him as being an expert or the most knowledgeable person on Spanish (incidentally he is a Dartmouth English professor too). Nevertheless, I am happy to have had the opportunity to take beginning Spanish with him.

Take this course.  I really love Spanish, and so I already have a bias for the language and hence the course.  However, if you want to learn Spanish, Professor Moody is definitely the prof to take.  He really tries hard to help us understand what is going on.  He will take the time that is needed to make sure that you understand.  The class is interesting also.  So if you like Spanish, or at least are interested, then you should take this course.

Given the material that is covered, the course moves along pretty quickly.  We covered everything I learned in 3 years of high school in 10 weeks.  There are 8 chapters covered which is a crapload of material if you've never had spanish before...  If you have had it before, it's a really easy course.  Prof. Saucedo is great and I would highly recommend taking it with her.

The class was good, the prof wasn't. As a person she's really nice and friendly, but she treated us like we were still in highschool. I think she's only started teaching recently and that with time she will improve. Her lectures were ineffective, and most of what I learned was from the book, not her lectures. She spent very little time explaining the material, grammar and vocab in class and instead she did activities during class, but most of that time was spent by her trying to organize groups and decide who was going to be in what group. Exams were easy.
@
Irasema Saucedo
/course/2833
This was Irasema Saucedo's first year at Dartmouth, and overall I felt she did a good job with Spanish 1. The syllabus moves right along with the text, covering about two full chapters per week. If you've had Spanish in high school, the first few weeks will probably be cake for you and you won't need to study much, but the ball gets rolling around midway in the term and most of us found ourselves having to work harder. The course mainly consists of participation (lots of speaking in class), exams/compositions, and drill. The exams weren't too hard, especially since they only covered about a week or two's worth of material at a time...there are plenty of exams to do well on if you screwed up one early on. Compositions consisted of writing short essays/paragraphs in Spanish, mostly using the same material/vocab as in the current chapter being studied. I took the afternoon drill session, and although it interrupts your day, it was much better than waking up at some ungodly hour.
@
Irasema Saucedo
/course/2833
Irasema is all you can hope for in a professor; she is lively, friendly, approachable, easy grader, and even helps you out (the whole class) when you can't remember what a word means in spanish! She is genuinely interested in the broken spanish you speak, and is very sensitive about your responses. Her laugh brightened up the 9 am class and made it all the more bearable. I hadn't taken any spanish before, and was a little worried about how I'd do, but ended up getting straight As. As long as you study the daily vocab and attend classes and drills (you don't have much choice, after 2 misses your participation grade goes down) you'll have no problem getting your A. I can write well in spanish now and even thinking about an LSA or FSP even though I wasn't that serious about spanish before! Irasema made me love spanish, take it with her and just be as respectful as you would to any prof and you'll have the time of your life.

Also, if you can help it,  take the afternoon drill instead of morning drill, unless you are a morning person and like getting up for a 745am class. But it's not so bad though; at least it was fun, and you got it out of the way!

Though the book/syllabus from the department covered materials way too quickly during the latter half the course--I found the professor to be very enganging ang interactive when teaching this subject. Her energy in the morning is refreshing.

The prof (Nati) is awesome.  She was always so excited for class, and was always extremely well prepared.  The class moves quickly, and it's pretty much necessary that you stay up to date on the reading in the book.  Lots of vocab, but we didn't really get tested on that as much as the grammatical stuff.  I had a lot of fun and learned a LOT.  Taking Spanish 2 with the same prof hopefully in the spring.

the prof is enthusiastic about her teaching and very energetic.  she was kind of a hard grader, and didn't seem to deal too well when people did badly, but that's probably just because she cares a lot.

Professor Barantseva is energetic, funny, and likeable - qualities which are very important when taking a 9S. She kept us awake and entertained, and we probably learned some Spanish too. She was also very understanding about sicknesses and other reasons for absences.  Most of the actual language retention is done in drill class, and about 90% of what you learn, you'll teach yourself from the book. Be forewarned that any language 1 class will be a ridiculous amount of work in a very short period of time - think 1 hour of class, 1 hour of drill, and AT LEAST 1 hour of homework EVERY DAY.   Additional homework assignments were common, and falling behind was not really an option.  If you pick up languages easily, this class will be the easiest you take at Dartmouth. It's not difficult, just a LOT of work.

This course has quite a bit more work than you might expect. I don't know if its the professor or the course itself, but with drill, the exercises, the reading, and the extra stuff, it can get pretty heavy sometimes. If you want to do well in the course, expect about 2 hours a day in work outside of class. And btw, DO NOT PICK A MORNING DRILL!!!! You will not be at your top efficiency and the lack of sleep will drive you nuts. Trust me.
@
Natalia Barantseva
/course/2833
I came into this class with zero Spanish experience, but managed to pick it up pretty quickly.  Drill, although really early, helped tremendously.  The homework in the book is a great way to review for Nati's tests.  The tests are more comprehensive than the typical "translate this sentence" kind of test.  She'll have a dialoge where you have to fill in pronouns, direct objects, missing words.  There is always an oral question on the reading where you have to write the question she dictates word for word and then write the answer (either from the passage she reads or from the story you are supposed to understand from the night before).  Nati is an energetic and fun professor, always smiling, and very clear in her lectures.  She will never hesitate to explain a concept further to you.  One thing that she likes is for the class to speak in Spanish--even if it is broken.

Spanish 1 is going to be Spanish 1 with anyone, but Profesora Polli was absolutely WONDERFUL. She has the coolest life, she's so enthusiastic about what she teaches, and she was definitely the most engaging professor I've ever had. She's approachable, funny, candid, and definitely a fair grader. If you need to take Spanish 1, take it with her--it'll make it so much better!!
@
Elizabeth Chamberlain
/course/2833
the prof and class are fun - you'll be conversing in Spanish about anything by the end of the trimester. Definitely helps to know Spanish or a closely-related language (less memorizing, more refreshing). Do the work book & book assignments in pieces over days not the night before or the day that it's due - ACTUALLY do it - it helps as review, esp. for tests. Getting up at the crack of dawn & walking through rain for drill - not fun. Having a funny drill class and good AT - makes it worth it. Do not be intimidated if you don't understand most of Cuentame. Watch the videos, they're all on the tests, you get asked about them in class, and you'll have to answer questions about them.

Elizabeth Chamberlain (aka Elizabeth Polli) is definitely one of the best profs on campus. Not one class is dull with her and she manages to inspire interest for everything. If you have the option to take spanish with her, DO IT. Work your schedule around her class because it will make your term much more enjoyable. And spanish 1 is spanish 1... do the work and you'll get a good grade. Don't fall behind and just do a consistent amount each day.

@
Elizabeth Chamberlain
/course/2833
Professor Polli was a great teacher.  She really taught the material well, and I feel like I mastered Spanish 1.  I genuinely enjoyed going to class everyday.  It was the best part of my day.  Unfortunately, Spanish 1 has drill 5 days a week. Since I played a sport, 745 class everyday sucked.  I didn't even find drill worthwhile to go to.  I learned everything in Polli's regular class.  The class is pretty fast paced, but if you put in a half hour a day you should be fine.  Most kids come into the class with a background in Spanish, but if you study a decent amount, you'll be fine.  There are four tests which equal 25% of your grade that are challenging, but everyone does well on them.  25% of your grade is participation, which everyone gets a perfect score for.  The final is 30% and writing exercises and a skit each are 10%.  It's a really fun class with a great teacher.  If you study a decent amount, you'll get a great grade and learn a lot.  Definitely take Spanish 1 with Polli.

Professor Chamberlain was amazing. Everyone in the class fell in love with her, and I fell in love with the Spanish language. Before coming to Dartmouth, I hated Spanish, but after Chamberlain's class, I have decided to take many more language classes. She is very energetic and fun, and very easy to understand. If you don't know why something in the language happens like it does, ask her and she'll explain (in spanish, of course) it to you so well that you will always remember it. She shows an exceptional interest in her students and her enthusiasm for the language is very contagious. I highly recommend her for Spanish 1, adn any other Spanish class you could take from her!

This was a fantastic class!  Professor Chamberlain is a great woman and a brilliant professor.  Class, although it met 5 times a week, was a pleasure and full of laughter.    The amount of Spanish we actually learned over 10 weeks is astounding.  Not only do we now speak the language, but we learned relevant vocab and grammar.  If you're thinking of ever taking Spanish, prof Chamberlain is the way to go.

This class was incredibly fast paced and included lots of busy work, but Prof. Chamberlain was lively, helpful, and always made class enjoyable.

There's a reason this class is called "intensive."  In addition to class every day and drill every day, there is extra class every Monday and Thursday, and about half the Wednesday nights there are movie viewings.  There's homework every night and about one quiz per week, and Portuguese soap operas to watch and write reviews of.  So the class requires a lot of time and effort, but despite all that, it's a wonderful class, and after spending so much time with the same people every day, you get to know everyone pretty well, which is nice.  However, to be honest, I would have been much more stressed out with the class if I had not taken Spanish throughout high school, because it helps a LOT with Portuguese.  I know those of us in the class that took Spanish had less trouble with the intensity of the course.
@
Piers Armstrong
/course/2833
Intensive portuguese is an great class but also a huge time commitment. There was about 12 - 14 hours a week of inclass time (includes drill, class, and movies) plus homework assignments. Professor Armstrong is a decent prof who is very enthusiastic about portuguese. I am glad I took this course but it was a major time commitment.
@
Piers Armstrong
/course/2833
You need to be serious about your commitment to Portuguese in order to have success in this course. It is not for the casual interest it is a boot camp for the brain.  Class meets at least once a day. Drill is daily and required for both Port 1 and Port 3. The class uses both X hours because it meets in the 10 and 10A time slot. So on some days it is possible to have Portugues 3 times a day.  The workload is intense but you will learn A LOT. Also the program has an awesome foreign study in Salvador in Brasil that is a great incentive to keep up the work. If you have a sincere interest in learning you will be successful. Previous Spanish/other Romance Language study will help out a lot. If you are a fluent Spanish speaker you will be ahead.
@
Piers Armstrong
/course/2833
This course takes up about 14 hours a week, just in class time not including hw so you have to be really motivated to learn portuguese.  There a lot of homework, but mostly all exercises in a workbook, so not too bad.  the parts i enjoyed the most about the class was the cultural stuff like listening to music and watching movies.  I thought Piers was a fair professor, his tests weren't that bad.  Knowing Spanish beforehand makes the course a whole lot easier.
@
Piers Armstrong
/course/2833
Portuguese is a beautiful language, and the LSA+ to Salvador is definitely worth taking the course. However, Piers is probably one of the worst language teachers I've ever had in my life, and I've taken four different languages within my lifetime. First off, he's a very bad lecturer, and he's very unresponsive during class time. He's not helpful during office hours because he makes you feel stupid for asking questions. And he doesn't know how to test. There's a lot of work you'll have to put into the class because we meet 2 to 3 times a day with drill and have daily homeworks, but all that work wont amount to anything when you take a test because what he tells you to study and what he puts on the exams are two different things. He has really made portuguese overly difficult, but if you want to have anything to do with the portuguese language here, you HAVE to take his courses because he's one of the only two profs of portugese at Dartmouth. He's much better at Portuguese 20 and the higher level courses, but I can't stomach him. Having his class for two terms definitely was one of the worst aspects of my dartmouth experience so far.  Oh yeah, if you have a strong Spanish background, you'll do better on exams. But if you dont have a Spanish background, don't take it. It isn;t worth the aggrivation
@
Piers Armstrong
/course/2833
Piers was a bad prof. I could have done without him. But I had a background in Spanish so that made things a whole lot easier. As other people have said, I completely agree that it is best to take this class with a Spanish background, otherwise you'll be playing catch-up. Also, this course required so much work, I think we had 13 hours of class, drill, movies, mesa portuguesa, and some other activity that I can't remember every week and he did take role! However, I did feel somewhat prepared for my LSA+ in Brazil and absolutely fell in love with the country.
@
Piers Armstrong
/course/2833
I took Portuguese 1 out of my love for the sound of the language and the music of Antonio Carlos Jobim. Now after finishing the two course sequence, my love for the language and Brazillian music is as strong as ever, but my feelings about the teaching I received in those two terms is quite different.   Piers Armstrong is a terrible professor. He consistently showed himself to be highly disorganized and unable to inspire students in any way. He made little effort in class to answer our questions, generally brushing our concerns aside and moving on. Occasionally he would riducule us.   As a student in Portuguese 1, you will see a lot of Professor Armstrong.  There are many outside-of-class weekly meetings included in the Portuguese 1 curriciulum. This being the case, I would only recommend taking Portuguese with Piers Armstrong to someone who has a strong interest in the language or Brazillian culture. Otherwise, you would be better off taking another language.  Stephen Wood '05
@
Piers Armstrong
/course/2833
Portuguese 1 and 3 are best suited for students who have a strong background in Spanish. You will find 80-90% of your classmates fall into this category, which means that they have an advantage. The class is taught using Spanish as an example. If you are really interested in learning Portuguese I recommend getting a tutor for the term to supplement class time.  Be warned This class will take up a large chunk of your time. The class requires daily drilling, weekly movies, and other meetings with the entire  class outside of class time. This does not include your homework time.  I had Professor Armstrong, who is one of the worst profs. I have ever had. His in-class notes resemble giberish. His notes on papers and homework are crytic. Also he does a poor job of adequately explaining key concepts of the language. He is more intent on utilizing the outdated video clips to waste valuable class time, than taking the time to prepare and adequate lesson.   The only redeeming quality of this program is the fact that after two terms you can go to Brazil and truly learn to speak the language.
@

This course was only enjoyable for me because I love languages and i think that Portuguese is beautiful and that Brazilian culture is interesting.  My drill instructors and my fellow classmates were a great help, but Professor Armstrong was not.  He just does not make class interesting...He goes by the book way too much and often comes across cold and inflexible...Since this class is a huge time committment, i would not take it unless you really want to learn portuguese, because it is just not fun to learn from Armstrong.

Sometimes it is as much the kids in your class as it is the prof. who teaches it. The dynamic between the prof and the student in this class was great.

Do not take this class unless you are willing to learn all the material on your own. The teacher will not teacher the material that you need to know for the test. The test are very difficult and vastly different from anything that you go over in class.
@
Alba Sanchis
/course/2833
I took three years of Spanish in high school so I'm probably not the fairest reviewer. If you've taken some Spanish in high school, don't take Spanish 1 for a review. Just look the material over and take Spanish 2. I enjoyed the class though. It was fun and Alba, though very strict the first day, is nice. She relaxes so don't drop the class because you think she'll be too strict. As for tests, learn how to use commas like Nathaniel Hawthorne and write ridiculously long sentences.
@
Alba Sanchis
/course/2833
Coming to class was pretty fun, but the lectures and activities in class were hit or miss.  The material was rarely explained in class, but was never really difficult to understand.  Alba was definitely excited about teaching, and she usually did a fairly good job, but I think that she will get better as she teaches more.  Tests were pretty ambiguous and confusing.  The best advice I have is to write long responses.  The tests say minimum of ten words, but we didn't find out for a while that minimum didn't mean lowest for an A, but rather lowest acceptable answer.  Getting a good grade is kind of tough because there is no curve and an A is a 95%.  But there is a large participation grade, which is helpful.  Drill is very helpful, and can be fun if you have a good drill instructor.  All in all, it was alright, don't try to switch into it, but don't be afraid if you're stuck with it.
@
Alba Sanchis
/course/2833
Alba this term was a new Prof, and so nobody knew what to expect in her class. There were def. mixed feelings about the way she taught. I was a big fan of Alba. She comes off as super serious at the begining, but loosens up. Know that after the first week, she speaks and expects only Spanish in class. Its scary at first, but you get used to it, and it helps you adjust to the language.   Alba is very friendly, quirky and entertaining in class. Perhaps it is because she is so young, but in class conversations were pretty relaxed. TALK as much as possible no matter how  bad your Spanish is, because she doesn't care. Participation is a huge part of your grade, and she MARKS DOWN how much you talk. Get on her good side and speak mucho espanol. She is very approachable.   My complaint is that the lecture material is relatively random. I wouldn't even consider them lectures. Expect to stand up a lot and do a lot of peer to peer interactions and talking/questions. Its pretty fun, but doesn't really help you understand the material. There are a lot of games and skits as well. It is a very interactive class, so you won't fall asleep. We covered about 1/2 chapters every 2 weeks with tests every.   It is true that there are few formal lectures on things like grammar. Expect a lot of self study from the book. The class is easy if you have taken Spanish in high school, but I can see why it can be difficult for a total novice. There is a lot of busy work, and even more for people new to spanish. Material is fairly rapid paced. Grade wise, it is hard to get a straight A because the bar is set so high at a 95, uncurved tests, easy to get anything below that if you put the time into it.   The one thing that stood out in this class was her tests. Many times the material didn't correlate with the lectures.  Vocab wasn't really straight up tested but you needed it to understand questions/paragraphs. Some questions can be tricky because of the complexity of the sentences used (more then we learned in class), and sometimes tenses etc never taught (past test on the first test?). Also on long answers WRITE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE and abuse the commas. She is all about pushing the spanish boundaries writing wise. As bad as the tests are, Alba seems to be a forgiving/lenient and fair grader. Nevertheless, expect ambiguous grading. Apparently some mistakes count more then others.   Overall not a bad class, esp. as a freshman. If you had spanish in HS you will do fine, expect lots of work if you are totally new.  Talk a lot with Alba/ In class. Alba is great  makes the class entertaining. I wouldn't suggest switching in, but get ready for some memorable class bonding if you get placed in!

Monetti made this class much harder than it should have been. As someone who's never studied Spanish before, the material was very easy to learn, but Monetti is a tough grader and made the class my hardest workload of the term. Her tests were significantly harder than other profs' -- our second midterm was 8 pages long for a 50-minute block and included a composition, which many students struggled to finish. She is not good about emailing students back and entered many of my grades wrong on Canvas, which I had to tell her to correct. We were required to watch two Spanish films and write about them on exams. Additionally, we had to attend and write about two experiential learning events, which you simply cannot understand when you're in Spanish 1. However, Monetti is a nice woman and genuinely cares that you're learning.

Spanish 2 is a bit of an intense class, moving through a lot of the Spanish language pretty quickly.

Prof. Gema Mayo-Prada (I think it still says Pushee on here) is awesome. If you have to take Spanish 2 (I did for an LSA) take it with her! She is really nice and helps everyone understand the subject matter.

Pushee is a very good prof, very energetic, helpful, etc.    The class isn't great.  I thought that there were some organizational problems with the class and it was not as straightforward as it could have been.  It was never really made clear what we needed to know (e.g. we needed to know vocab from chapters for drill, but not class?!) and tests would focus excessively on seemingly minor concepts at the expense of material we spend a lot of time covering.    Prof. Pushee is good, but I wish the class could have been more clear in exactly what we needed to master (e.g. vocab or no vocab), have better coordination with drills, and have tests that more accurately tested what we learned.
@
Gema M.

Take it with Prof. Pushee if you are looking to get Span. 2 out of the way because she knows what she is doing.

Pushee is a great prof. Class wasn't intimidating like other language classes I've taken. I didn't think drill was too bad either, it helped my speaking temendously.

This course wasn't particularly interesting, it was mostly a focus on the grammar.  But if you want to learn spanish, I recommend taking this class with Pushee.  She's tough but fair and willing to give you the benefit of the doubt.
@
Gema M.
/course/2834
On the surface, this course doesn't cover much.  But the devil is in the details.  You really need a solid understanding of things from Spanish 1 to start off well in this class-there's 2 days of review and then it's off to new material.  If you aren't completely confident in your spanish from high school, think before taking this class.  If you struggeld through Spanish 1, be sure to review it during the first week of class.  That can make the difference between perpetually playing catch-up and learning the material well.

This class was pretty much what I expected, and Pushee is a great teacher who really seems to care about her students.  She was sick this term (as was half the school this winter), so we had to cancel a few classes, but she was really great about making everything up before the exam.  I really liked this class, and Pushee was good.

Pushee is a really good prof.  She's upbeat and very approachable, and makes the class interesting.  Drill was a pain but did help me understand the material. The class was generally easy and not much outside of class work.
@

/course/2834
This seems to be like most language classes. Not a terrible amount of work, but a lot of time spent on spanish because of in class time and drill. Pushee was fairly strict, and you definitely do not want to miss class or come unprepared if you have her as your teacher. She does try and help you when you need it though.

For a mandatory class (if you've decided to take Spanish to satisfy the language requirement) this class was exceptional.  The classwork was easy and a lot of work was done in pairs.  The most difficult part was the workbook, which was not that difficult at all.

Decent course, about what I expected. One cautionary note if you're like me and you only have a term of Spanish under your belt, be prepared to play catch-up. Many of the students in the class have taken 4+ years of Spanish and can make you look stupid.

this class was the best of the term for me. Prof Pushee is a great prof, and she really cares whether or not the students learn the material.  She was always available and is so energetic and not intimidating at all.  The class was fun and drill was fine too.
@
Gema M.
/course/2834
The class is somewhat interesting and Senora Pushee does a good job, but it's just too much work for my taste.  You go through about a chapter per week, which means about 75 new vocab words and a couple new tenses.  It really helps if you've taken Spanish before, as the kids who were in Spanish 1 had more difficulty than people who had taken Spanish in high school.

Regular spanish class, Prof. Pushee is very helpful.
@
Gema M.
/course/2834
If you've taken high school spanish, this class is very easy. If you can study at all to test out, I recommend it, because the class was basically all review, and drill is not fun. You can only miss a combined total of 2 classes or drills, or it affects your grade, which is tough.  The tests are easy, as are essays, but the workbook exercises are kind tedious. You can pull off a good grade with almost no work, and Pushee tries to make it interesting- class time usually passes pretty quickly.

The class was alright, but Prof Pushee is a great teacher.
@
Gema M.
/course/2834
It was a pretty easy class.  There were only a couple one-page writing assignments and some worksheets to do, which usually weren't collected anyway.  However, I probably learned more from Drill than the actual class, and some people seemed to have difficulty with the way she taught and explained some of the tenses.  If you're pretty confident with your ability in Spanish, this class should be a cinch.
@
Gema M.
/course/2834
The course was interesting, even for me, a non-major who was taking it to get the language credit. If language is not your thing, be sure to get outside help or visit the prof in office hours to have any confusing grammar points explained.

Spanish 2 was exactly what I expected it to be.  It was pretty easy, not that interesting and pretty much the same as a high school spanish class.  It wasn't terrible but it definitely wasn't memorable either...just your basic intro spanish class, nothing more, nothing less.  The tests were a little more difficult than the material we covered in class, but they were a fair assessment and nothing to freak out over.  Pushee is a pretty good teacher, a little difficult to understand at first because of her Spanish (i.e. from Spain) accent but you get used to it within a week.
@
Gema M.
/course/2834
span 2 was a fun course, aside from the extra hour per day spent at drill, but that extra "mandatory" hour saves you lots of homework time, to be well spent on other courses.  the material is interesting too, if you're into learning about other cultures and such.  PLUS, i hear the mexico LSA is awesome, so taking this class brings you one step closer to it.
@
Gema M.
/course/2834
The professor was good.  I like Spanish profs because they are so energetic, and she definitely was.  Sometimes didn't explain things well, but most of the material is easy to understand.  Waking up for drill sucks, and doesn't really prepare you for the oral skills you would want before an LSA (like me).  The tests were kind of hard, but everyone does poorly so it evens out (the tests for all Spanish 2 classes are the same so it doesn't matter).  She responds well over blitz, but has spotty office hours.  Don't be surprised if her kid/kids are there during office hours or right before a test (cute though).  A lot of the students are there just because of the language requirement (like retarded basketball players) so don't expect too much.

Professor Pushee at first seems kind of strict, but she's actually pretty nice. Unlike some of the other spanish teachers, she doesn't treat you like you are a kintergardener. Unlike spanish 1, spanish 2 (only) has 4 classes per week and 4 drills per week (spanish 1 has both 5 days a week).   the in class activities are kind of stupid and usually involve going around the class asking different people stupid questions and having them respond in spanish. she talks about 95 percent of the time in spanish, even when explaining grammatical rules and vocabulary - which can be hard at times, but probably is for the better. I think i improved my listening  a lot from this course.   There is no homework except handing in review books to your drill instructors. There are a few short compositions and you have to study for a few essays. You are supposed to follow along in the book and study the lessons and vocab before going into every class, but that's usually doesn't take much time, and nothing happens if you don't study before every class. There is one stupid assignment where you have to go on some web page , read some story in spanish, and submit answers to questions view the web. the whole exercise (called "Borges y Yo") is pointless. The spanish department makes all spanish2 profs assign this so that it can claim it invokes technology and innovative teaching techniques.   Professor Pushee's tests aren't that hard, but for some reason she does not grade on a scale or curve, and she does not round grades up - even from .5. For example, to get an A, you have to have an average of over 95 percent - no matter if nobody in the class gets an A or if everybody in the class gets an A. in reality, hardly anybody gets one b/c of this. As she explained to us, in the hypothetical situation that everybody in the class had a 94.8% average, nobody would be given an A.

Class was fairly interesting. Prof Guzman is very energetic & really makes an effort to engage her students. She genuinely cares about us too. Her lectures weren't always the clearest, b/c she assumes a certian level of experience with the language & that you read the chapter/teach yourself before class.  Homework was  decent, to your benefit if you chose to do it well. Exams were mostly based on grammar, as opposed to vocabulary. Overall it was a good class & pretty painless if you just want to get your spanish 2 credit.

snra guzman-bueno was amazing, it was definately my easiest class of the term and if i had done my work i probably would have gotten an A. i thought the class was very easy, but I did take spanish for 5 years before it, so for people who have only taken Spanish 1 so far at Dartmouth, the course probably will seem pretty fast paced, but the prof is very willing to help you. she's probably the nicest teacher i've ever had and she has a great passion for spanish/teaching and is always excited and happy during class. i'd recommend this class to anyone bc if you like or have taken spanish a lot it will be very easy and you won't do much work, and if you don't know much the she'll really help you

Guzmen-Bueno is one of the greatest teachers at this school. As a student, she engages you in her lectures. You will enjoy this course. Simply remember that this course is still a language course. It is necessary that you attend all classes and drills, and you attend everything, you will be fine. Guzmen is Awesome. As for the course, you are looking at 4 small writing assignments, 3 test, 1 oral test, and a final. It sounds like a lot of stuff, but it really is not that much because most of it is pretty simply. Also, with Guzmen-Bueno, you will be more than prepared for everything. This is why I would recommend the course to anyone. It is like Guzmen-Bueno really cares about your progress as a Spanish Student Learning the language. She will help you if you are concerned about having NO Spanish Background prior to Spanish One. Nough said, try to GO WITH GUZMEN if you have options. She is simply the best.

I'm really glad that I took Spanish 2 with Guzman - she's very sweet. Plus, she's really funny. Classes were always lively and entertaining. She's really good about getting all students involved, and is patient with responses. She made a huge effort to get to know everybody in the class personally, and was very sympathetic to our individual needs. Exams were entirely fair, and pretty easy - there wasn't ever anything unexpected. We also had in-class essays, on which we were allowed to use our textbooks and dictionaries; an oral presentation (about 5 minutes); and an individual oral interview (about 10 minutes).   My only gripe about this class is that because of placement tests, etc., and the extraordinarily fast pace of languages at Dartmouth, I was in the same class as kids who had taken AP Spanish in high school - and I'd only had 10 weeks of Spanish 1 here. It was sometimes hard to keep up. However, that's a problem you're going to run into in any of the departments, and not at all specific to the course or Guzman.  I'd recommend taking Spanish 2 with Guzman if you are going to take it. Her course is definitely a little harder than some of the other profs', but that's because she really makes you learn. If I'm going to be waking up at 745am every morning, I want to actually remember my Spanish a few months from now! However, if you put the effort in, it's not hard to do well.

She genuinely cares about all of her students, and seems to be in the habit of starting to cry a little bit at the end of every term when she's saying goodbye.  She gives beautiful lectures in Spanish on things like young love, world issues, friendship, human nature, her hopes and dreams, and the Spanish language itself. She'll make you see that learning Spanish can mean more than just fulfilling your language requirement.  If you're taking Spanish 2, there is no reason whatsoever to take it with anyone else. Drop a conflicting class and get into her section... you won't regret it!

The period flew by every single day.  Either she was giving us hugs and kisses or breaking into random song and dance or trying to hook people up with dates.  She is so much fun and so sweet!!!  Do whatever you have to to try to get Guzman as your prof.  And, if you can swing it, I would definitely recommend signing up for afternoon drill.  It can get annoying, but you'll appreciate the sleep and you can always do a morning drill every once in a while.

I had a great experience with the Spanish department when I took Spanish 1, but was disappointed to find that the quality of the intro language classes depends greatly on the professor.  The course itself is not difficult, but dealing with Carrizo presented some challenges.  I don't think she's still teaching but if she is and you wind up in her section, be warned that she plays favorites and picks them early.  Be on time, and don't talk unless you are volunteering a response.  She liked me early on but I fell out of her favor after giving an (admittedly weak) oral presentation.  There doesn't seem to be a way to get back on her good side, so if she likes you, be careful.  if she doesn't like you, feel free to contradict her when she uses a reading assignment as a jumping-off point for a lengthy monologue about what is wrong with the world today---those of your classmates who are still conscious will thank you for cutting her off.

the course itself is fine, if you study the book daily and do the work you're supposed to. but cecilia carrizo is very unpredictable, may march into the classroom completely mad or very happy depending on her days. your grade pretty much depends on whether she likes you, and she likes you if you do all the work, but sometimes other factors may get involved... so take it with her, but make sure you don't miss any work otherwise you're in for a responsibility lecture like you used to get in middle school.

Cecilia is very sweet.  She demands the respect of a student-professor relationship, but as long as you respect her she is great.  Class participation is a must for her.  But as long as you say something in class every day and you keep up with the grammar you should be fine.
@

I really loved this class. Professor Carrizo is very good at interacting with students and she expects that everybody participate during class. She knows how to inspire interest in the subject.

Professor Carrizo seems like a very stern woman to many students, but she actually really wants everyone to do well in the class and treats us nicely.

@
Cecilia I.
/course/2834
Professor Carrizo is not someone I would ever recommend.  The biggest problem is that she can hardly speak English, so if you don't understand something, you have no hope of being able to have her explain anything to you.  Unless you've taken Spanish in high school, or are otherwise comfortable with the language, find a different professor to take this course with.
@

/course/2834
I'd heard bad things about Cecilia before taking the class but I actually liked her.  If you did the homework and knew what was going on in class, you will have no problems and she will be very nice. Everything was very straightforward.  The tests were easy and the material came directly from the book- don't worry about vocab- and the reactions were on easy topics and graded easily. Drill is fine if you get a good TA.  Overall it was just what I expected out of Spanish 2.

From what I have heard about language at Dartmouth, it is fabulous.  However, Spanish 2 with "Cecilia", while rather easy, is a terrible class.  Carrizo lectures about her personal theories on life rather than teaching actual spanish.  She does not speak english well, has random mood swings, and I am pretty sure that she randomly distributes grades at the end of the term based on  how much she likes you.  I feel like i learned the spanish that we were supposed to learn through drill and the textbook, but not through the prof.  I, personally, felt that I would have had a much better spanish 2 experience with a better prof.  However, if you are looking for an easy spanish 2, without a lot of work... you should do fairly well in this class provided you are on carrizo's good side and are decent at spanish.

The professor is hard to understand at times. . .class is soooo boring
@

/course/2834
This is a fairly straightfoward language class.  Prof Carrizo is very nice and understanding if you put in an effort, though I think that her class time should be devoted more to teaching the material and less to lecturing in fasts spanish.  Exams can be kind of tricky, so beware.  Essays are in-class and are graded fairly leniently.  Don't worry so much about those, worry more about the tests.  And keep up with the material, if you can.  Practice practice practice, there is an oral interview at the end.

For me, this course was fairly easy because I learned most of the material in high school.  At times I found the prof to be a bit intimidating and so, if I had had more difficulties understanding the material, I would definitely have been less inclined to participate in class and might not have enjoyed the course as much.

I'm happy to be done with Spanish 2.  I took Spanish 1 and 2 here at school and both classes have been solid, but morining drill killed my life.  I'm just happy to get them out of the way, so I have no more drill to finish my language requirement.  Professor Moody isn't the greatest Professor, but he is an awesome guy and a really easy grader.  He's not a native Spanish speaker, so he would get some things wrong, but most kids didn't have the heart to correct him or didn't care. I learned mostly from the textbook and Spanish 1 gave me a good background, so I was fine for the tests. And the tests, were kind of a joke because I would sometimes get whole sections wrong and Moody wouldn't take more than one point off.    Moody is such a nice professor and a really cool guy.  If you just put like an hour a week into studying the textbook, this class can be torn up. I thought it was a really good class, but a lot of my peers may not like Moody's relaxed teaching style.  I would take it with Moody if he's an option for Spanish 2.

Moody's a great prof to take this course with. He's so nice and personable, and a really fair (easy?) grader. He practically tells you the entire exam the day before you take it, so it makes studying a breeze. He's also really open to different interpretations on grades, and will most likely award you extra points if you complain. Not the most interesting course just because of the nature of the material, but he's a great person, and made it a lot more enjoyable.

Very easy grader and the lectures are easy going. He likes his students and wants them to learn and cares less about the grade. Take spanish with him.

/course/2834
I learned entirely from my textbook and drill this term, because Professor Moody didn't teach anything in class. He's a really nice guy, and very laid back. However, there was no structure to his classes. He spent so much time talking about what we were going to be learning in the future that he never actually taught us what we were supposed to be learning in the present. If you don't think you can learn the material on your own, pick a different professor.

@

Prof Moody was a great guy and he was a laid back prof. this did make the class pretty easy, but since he isn't a native speaker he often didn't know the answer to grammatical or vocabulary questions, and I probably would have learned more with a different professor.

I had to take this class for the LSA and I'm very happy I took it with Moody. He is literally the chillest professor at Dartmouth and is so easy going in class. He gives you the benefit of the doubt with grading and is always available outside of class. I honestly looked forward to going to Spanish every day with him and I also learned a lot. If you have to take this class, take it with Moody. He's the man.
@
Douglas Moody
/course/2834
Moody is fantastic, he is corny, fun, and an easy grader. Who could ask for more? The only thing is, he doesn't really know the material all that well. We were correcting him all the time and he oftentimes did not know the definition of words or the particulars of a grammatical stucture. That got frustrating, my saving grace was my drill instructor who knew spanish VERY well. All in all, take it with Moody but if you have questions that are a little bit more complex, don't expect him to know the answer. Honestly, we did less than half the work of the other classes and we did just as well if not better.

It is often really hard to learn Spanish when you are not being taught by a native speaker. It was hard to learn the material when the professor didn't know the answers or the best words to use.

Spanish 2 was a good course that supplemented the material of spanish two, but with a greater focus on grammer and less on vocabulary. This class may look easy, but you should definately be ready to put some work in after class. Overall good course and helped with the building on topics covered in spanish 1.

Spanish 2 is fairly easy, but morning drill is the worst. However, being forced to speak spanish early in the morning does seem to improve your speaking skills, so the extra class time is pretty usefull.  I would recommend taking the afternoon drill if you can.  Nati was pretty enthusiastic about the class, which made learning easier.  Overall it's a pretty good class.
@

/course/2834
Nati is an amazing prof.  She's really lively and interactive and very fair.  I thought the course in itself was really hard, but perhaps I shouldn't have been placed in Spanish 2.  I had taken 5 years of Spanish before taking the class, but I didn't remember most of it and had a really hard time keeping up no matter how hard I studied, which was pretty frustrating.  It's really faced paced, so it makes it harder to catch up if you're behind from the start.

This was Nati's first term teaching at Dartmouth I believe, and she is great! She makes class interesting, and is tuned into her students' attitudes.  She grades fairly and gives helpful comments.

I really enjoyed this class. It helped develop my Spanish so that I feel fairly comfortable speaking and can express myself fairly well. Natalia was very energetic, and she made class interesting. In the beginning, it was a little difficult because I felt like she went a little fast. I think this was mainly because she spoke more quickly than I was used to, and I had to get used to it. This forced me to become a better listener though, and in the end I was better for it. She also always invited us to Spanish events outside of class like Salsa parties or movie nights at La Casa. This really helped us to put what we were learning into context, and it proved that she really cared about our learning and interest in the language and its culture. I definitely recommend it.

Saucedo is the kind of prof who makes you look forward to class, but doesn't really teach you all that much. Considering that it's Spanish 2 though, you can easily learn everything you need to from the book, and just relax.

Irasema Saucedo
/course/2834
I came into this Spanish class with 3 years of high school Spanish and I have to say that even though I waited to winter term to take it, it was not a hard class and you will be fine if you know general spanish along with a variety of tenses. The course emphasizes heavily on the subjunctive, so before you begin- you may want to review. Overall, it was an easy course and I really did not have to study or seriously review until the last 2 weeks with the introduction of the future and conditional tenses. If you take a little time to review, your Spanish will improve a lot in just a single term. Professor Saucedo is a great prof, very amiable and approachable, but she has limited knowledge of the usage of "vosotros" and the vosotros form is testable material in this course.

Irasema Saucedo
/course/2834
Her colloquial style is very effective. Asking every student about his or her weekend got us speaking on a normal topic that some of us might encounter on LSAs. Skits were amazingly effective, especially the casual ones that we did to break up the class time.  It kept me focused on the class material so I actually learned the material while in class.
@
Irasema Saucedo
/course/2834
The class itself is so-so but Prof. Saucedo is definitely enthusiastic and energetic when she teaches which helps.  The class material itself didn't help me that much at all basically because just reading the book suffices to learn the material.  The workbook and problems at the end of the chapter are required for the drill class and that was the main biatch of this class.  Otherwise it's a very doable class and getting an A isn't difficult if you study just a little each week.

This class was okay.  Not terrible but not great either.  I think the tests, which are made by the deptartment for all the spanish 2 classes, were a little unreasonable.  They are nothing like what you work on in class and are much more difficult that your workbook.   Prof. Naranjo is pretty nice and understanding but the stuff they give him to do with the class are sort of dumb and he didn't really give us other stuff to work on.  He also doesn't really get excited..so that makes the class pretty boring at 9 in the morning...

Professor Naranjo brought an interesting perspective to our Spanish 2 class. I learned the material for the tests, but because there was so much material to cover is such a short period I hope that I actually retain some of the things I learned.  It was difficult at times to stay current with the material, but I suggest doing the exercises in the workbook because they correlate very well with the professor’s syllabus. It is requirement to take three sections of a foreign language so in retrospect; we did what we needed to…

Prof. Naranjo was great in Spanish 2.  He was lots of fun and really tried to spruce up what turned out to be a lot of dry material.  This course matches its descriptions...lots of grammar, lots of drill, and a lot of immersion in the language.

I didnt get the grade I think I deserved, but I still loved this class. Naranjo is really funny, and I enjoyed going to class every day.

Paloma Asensio
/course/2834
Spanish 2 had 8 weekly assignments with ~80 questions each. Each assignment took me seven hours to do (I got a high grade on them). The class had two midterms and a final which were straightforward and graded objectively. I simply memorized the tenses and vocab on the textbook pages listed in the syllabus and did very well. There was also two essays and a speaking final, which were much less straightforward to prepare for. I didn’t study for the essays and didn’t do great on them. I also didn’t use Spanish spell check in word on the first essay - that was a big mistake, make sure you use it! I spent 8 hours memorizing all 5 situations on the speaking final and did well. Overall the class seemed to have more work than was needed to cover its rather simple vocab, tenses and language constructs - about 10 hours a week outside of drill and lecture, which granted is still a lot less than a hard Dartmouth course like ECON 26 or COSC 50. Besides the essays and speaking final, the class felt like a high school Spanish class. Professor Paloma was helpful and enthusiastic in class. All the assignments and exams and drills were made by the department, so no matter what professor you have your experience will likely be similar.

I was a bit nervous when I signed up for this class, since I hadn't taken any Spanish in two years (I took three years of high-school spanish, nothing advanced like AP).  But there wasn't much to worry about, the class moves at a very reasonable pace and there are very few assignments, just occasional midterms and essays.  The hardest part is drill, which you have to take 4 days a week, early in the morning or late in the afternoon, so that you'll only be half-awake either way.  Prof. Asensio is very understanding and is very patient with the many unmotivated people who are just trying to get their language requirement out of the way while still keeping it interesting for people who actually want to learn some spanish.

Polli (or Chamberlain, I guess she married?) is an amazing teacher. She's enthusiastic, funny, gets everyone involved, everything you could hope for. Class was never boring, she did a great job of explaining the lessons. You have to take this class for your foreign language requirement, but it's so much fun that you won't even notice.

I love Professor Polli. She makes everything interesting and truly cares about her students.

I truly believe that she is the best in the department, and by far one of the best professors I've had at Dartmouth.

Professor Diaz is absolutely great! He is hilarious. He makes class so much fun and it was my favorite class this term and def top 3 at Dartmouth overall. This class is very conversational and he encourages students to speak in Spanish and make mistakes.  If you go ahead and just speak Spanish even if you're bad at it (which I def was) you will have a good time. The homework was easy and pretty much nonexistent because he never collected daily assignments.  However for the tests you had to know what you were doing or it might be too difficult.  If you study, itâ€™s easy. I would take any class with this prof.
@
Sebastian Diaz
/course/2834
Spanish 2 with Professor Diaz was a pleaure.  The professor is very personable, funny, and engaging in the classroom.  He recognizes that each student in Spanish 2 has different strengths and weaknesses with the language and is accomodating to the abilities and needs of each student.  For those with a less extensive background in Spanish, do know that Spanish 2 is an immersion class; very little to no English is used while in class.  The professor is enthusiastic to help students who show independent interest in the course.  Realize that a significant portion of one's grade is a reflection of class participation.  Participate in class exercises and disscusions!

All right. Let's all start this off by agreeing that spanish 1 and 2 are not supposed to be hard classes. That having been said, however, Professor Diaz is NOT a good instructor. He is easy, but he is not an effective teacher at all. If you're looking for a trouble-free way to knock out the second level of your language requirement, you might want to take this class with Diaz. However, if you want to actually improve your Spanish and not walk out of class to the bathroom almost every day like I did because sitting in class literally numbs your brain, look elsewhere.

Still, a good refresher, and, as long as you don't miss classes or drills, you'll get a good grade.

Reading through the textbook and reviewing vocab before class makes the class much easier if you feel like you're falling behind.

This class is not difficult and is much like a high school Spanish class (minus drill, which really isn't that bad).

Prof. Carranza is scatter-brained and the whole class is only taught in Spanish, but if you skim the textbook before class and study the review page before a test you'll be fine.

Language req can be a drag, especially if you are bad at languages. I had Alba for Span 1, and so I've gotten to know her and her style well. I felt the transition from span 1 to 2 was drastic. The expectations during tests and essays was set much higher. Now, things like accents, spelling, complexity all matter, topics not really covered in Span 1. I struggled on the first few tests/ exams because I never mastered the tiny details. They ended up messing me up, but after a while you learn how the tests are set up. The more you write= better, but you HAVE TO BE CAREFUL. Tests are tricky.  Alba is fun as always, young and energetic. Go to office hours and it is obvious she cares about her students.

This class doesn't inspire much of anything unless you're planning to major/minor. Matorras practically plays charades while she talks and thus defeats the purpose of teaching the language. Also, some of her rules (about speaking in complete sentences and speaking only in Spanish in class) make it hard for people who are struggling with Spanish to improve - especially when they have questions.  Overall, it's a boring time-waster. And Cuentame (the Spanish telenovela you'll have to watch) is the bane of my existence.

/course/2834
Professor Antigua was awful. As someone who had just begun taking any language class the term before, Spanish 2 with Antigua was horrible. She was very fast-paced, which is understandable because we have so much to cover, and while with the more advanced students she was able to effectively communicate, with beginners like me she was totally unhelpful. I went to her office hours several times and not once was she understanding or helpful in explaining anything. As the second week approached I even got a tutor. We met 3-5 times a week and still my quiz and test scores did not improve. Her grading was very harsh. As the term progressed I realized I truly needed extra help, I asked her if she had any extra study material I could do on my own time that may help me prepare for the final so maybe my grade would get a boost and she denied giving me anything. I had friends in the other professors classes and they seemed much happier with their experiences. I was working hard and putting in an insane amount of time for a class that should not have been made this difficult for me. Only advice I can offer is that if you are an unexperienced first-time language learner, do not take this class with Antigua.

Profesora Velez is amazing - interesting in class, funny, and a great teacher. She also cares deeply about her students, and it's evident.  The class is a lot of work, especially with drill and all the outside supplemental videos and reading that you have to know for the tests.  The tests were easier than I expected, but Velez is a hard grader for sure. I definitely learned a lot in this class, but I felt like we rushed some concepts to keep up with the syllabus. I wish we could have slowed down just a bit to solidify our understanding.  Overall glad I took this class, and I'm interested to see how Spanish 3 will turn out.

Although Profesor Ivan was a visiting professor (so this was his only term), he was by far the most inspiring professor I have yet encountered at Dartmouth.  He instilled a love for the Spanish language that was amazing.  Not enough good things can be said about him.  The Spanish 2 class in general is very enjoyable.  Besides drill, the class is interesting, quickly paced so you don't get bored, but not overwhelming so you feel hopeless.  If you participate a lot, the class will teach you a lot of Spanish.  If you are coming from just having high school Spanish, this class is manageable, but still relatively tough.  If, for instance, you haven't taken h.s. Spanish in a while, you will still do fine, and will be happy not to go through the review of Spanish 1.

I didn't take Spanish 1 at Dartmouth, so I had a bit of a learning curve as to how language classes here work, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it.  Prof. Gema Mayo-Prada (I think it still says Pushee on here) is awesome. If you have to take Spanish 2 (I did for an LSA) take it with her! She is really nice and helps everyone understand the subject matter. She is also pretty young (compared to most of the profs) and does a lot of stuff involving Spanish music and TV, etc.  So again, if you have to take Spanish 2, take it with Gema!

Nicest prof. Always willing to help students and the class is not too rigorous. Classwork and homework is very relaxed. Grades tests and compositions very generously. As long as you try he will make sure you succeed in the class. In summary, prof. is a straight baller and class is exactly the vibe you are looking for in a Spanish class.

Course This course was engaging and greatly tests your level of Spanish. It definitely makes you work hard, but if you put in the effort, it greatly improves your spanish. Although the written exercises are not always engaging, it's definitely helpful and is never too much to the point of going crazy.   Professor Professor Gomez is the man. Def. makes you work hard, but if you put in the effort, you can really do well and improve your spanish. He is willing to go the extra mile for you, but only if you work hard. He knows how to make you want to work hard, so it's not so straining as it is engaging.   Workload Workload was pretty manageable. While Professor Gomez makes you work, it's never to the point of wanting to punch someone in the face. Work is pretty high, but not ridiculously.

Course The course was incredibly challenging, but in a good way. We always had to be 100% prepared for every class, and there was a bunch of work, but it was all beneficial and definitely helped us improve our Spanish.  Professor Antonio is a great professor. He expects a huge amount of effort from his students, but grades reasonably and genuinely cares about the progress of each student.  Workload Workload was manageable some days, but there were other days where many many hours were required to prepare for a debate, or something like that. It never seemed like busy work, though.

Though the course was what was expected--an introductory language course with a few interesting readings and/or videos here and there--Gomez totally made the class.  He's an amazing prof who totally inspired interest for the subject.  He's incredibly smart--I looked on his website and it says he has like 2 PhD's or something--and really helps to get students involved in the course.  Definitely take the class with Gomez if you can.

gomez is a great prof and a really nice person. you always have work in this class, but it's never too bad. the worst part for me were the compositions, because stupid mistakes add up to getting terrible grades on them. but you can hand in a second draft to improve your grade, which is really helpful. be prepared to speak a lot you can't do well in the class without participating all the time.

We had something to do for pretty much every class.  Sometimes it was a reading, sometimes a few pages of the workbook or a worksheet.  The homework wasn't too hard but it took time to complete.    Prof. Gomez is so nice and really understanding, encouraging, and enthusiastic.  I was sick a lot this term and because of this I had to miss 4-5 classes and he was really nice about it.    The only reason I didn't love this class was because I hadn't taken spanish in over a year and a half and had kind of forgotten how to speak it so it got frustrating sometimes in class when I didn't know how to say what I wanted to say.  If you are a freshman who didn't take spanish senior year of high school I might recommend that you take Spanish 3 instead..

This is a great course; took it freshman fall and it really kicked my ass into gear and out of the stagnant rut of high school Spanish...there is a lot of Antonio calling on random people because it's a very interactive class, but only to help participation grades and to make sure everyone's involved.  Make sure you do the readings, and make sure you at least get the gist, because they can be tricky at times. Sr. Gomez is very good with the readings and explaining concepts.  He has a good sense of humor and treats students like real people. He's also very willing to help with work outside of class, and checks his blitz about every 20 seconds. Tests are hard but fair.  Proofread your compositions fanatically. Definitely recommend this course

This class focused on reviewing Spanish grammar and perfecting writing skills. It wasnt that much work but the homework assigned was usually busy work.

This course is the perfect introduction to the study of Spanish literature.  It tests your speaking skills while also focusing on writing in an organized, as well as creative, manner.  Professor Gomez (Antonio) is encouraging and engaging, which makes the material covered in class even more compelling.  I can honestly say my Spanish has greatly improved over the course of this term because of his help.

Antonio rocks. He's very engaged and engaging in class. He makes the readings pretty interesting. It is a small, very involved class so you kind of have to do all the reading (if only skim it) and attend all the classes. I'd recommend the class if you're interested in Spanish whatsoever.
@
Antonio Gomez
/course/2839
Prof Gomez is very open, approachable, friendly and helpful to all students. He is an effective lecturer and sprinkles humor to keep students interested. With his help and the student's dedication, anyone can do well in this course.   The course itself is very well organized and well paced. The material is essentially as follows 4 short readings, 1 movie, and one novel. There are quite a bit of grammar and writing excercises (especially in the first phase of the course). Aside from this there are 5 assignments (3 compositions, 1 oral presentation and a written composition as final).   If the student is motivated and counts with the prof as resource, there is no reason to not do well in this class.

I really enjoyed this class - it wasn't too fast paced and it was interesting.  We read several short stories and a novel, and had 4 tests and 2 essays throughout the term.

ricardo bardo is a great spanish prof who teaches a pretty easy spanish 9 class. he uses some different in-class activities that involve a lot of group work in 2s or 3s and as a whole group. always day to day homework but it was never much. you get to hand in your papers after an edit by a classmate and by him so the grades are often good. take this class for a solid spanish class with a cool prof.
@
Ricardo Bardo
/course/2839
For one thing, we didn't learn anything about culture, which would have been nice.  The novel was horrible and above our level.  The two take home tests were bizzare and if you used the excercises handed out in class to help you, you most likely got the question wrong.  Bardo is a good guy and means well, but i think just doesn't quite have it down yet.
@
Ricardo Bardo
/course/2839
I didn't learn any Spanish, which was really frustrating.  We read an awful book as our only piece of literature (you'd think they could find something better...) and we had to read it in like 1 week.  Class time was not always spent in a very productive manner.  Prof. Bardo is a nice guy but he doesn't understand a lot of things.  A short list That he should TEACH what he's testing That he should test things that non-native speakers might be able to understand That none of us are native speakers, or else we wouldn't be taking the class  There was actually a ridiculous load of work, but only at times.  For instance, near the end of the term he decided he would have us read a novella, watch a movie, turn in a take-home test (yes, they're take-home and no, that doesn't help) and write a story.  For one day.  Ay, dios mio.    I would not recommend taking this class with Bardo.
@
Ricardo Bardo
/course/2839
Bardo was great except for a couple things. First of all, all of your compositions are edited by him after which you can revise them before you resubmit them for a grade. While this is really nice, it's kind of weird because that means that he's a really tough grader in the end, counting off 2 points for each minor error. Not too bad, right? But the stickler is that it rewards you to write really elementary sentences and very short compositions, which i dont think really teaches you much in the end. Also, the exams were purely grammatar-based, but they're open book and not taught in class. Pretty tough just because they're totally on the little nuances of the language. There's a consistent amount of homework (totally busywork, not graded, not hard), so take that into account too. But overall very good course.
@
Ricardo Bardo
/course/2839
Professor Bardo is a nice guy, and the class was interesting.  It was generally quite easy, and one could get a good grade while doing next to no work.  It also gives you an upper level spanish credit needed for the minor.  Good grade for no work is a rare find at dartmouth.  take this course if you have any affiliation with spanish.

Professor Bardo is amazing. He really inspired me to become a Spanish major. His lectures always helped to clarify the fuzzy parts of the readings. His assignments always served a purpose.

@
Ricardo Bardo
/course/2839
This was probably the easiest class I've taken at Dartmouth. All of your papers, including your final paper which is 20% of your grade, are edited by Bardo, then sent back to you. You make the corrections, and your grade is based on the edited version. There are 2 take home tests, about 4 1 page papers, and a class participation graded. Bardo is super friendly and chill, although at times he seems slightly confused as to what is going on, and isn't always that clear (he's a visiting prof). This class was easy and a lot of fun, but I'm slightly nervous for Spanish 37 because this is the prereq.
@

The class was filled with a range of spanish proficiency, from people who hadn't taken spanish in a year and a half and barely placed out of the language requirement to people who had just been in south america over the summer, but it was easy enough for me in the bottom of the class to follow along without too much difficulty.  the professor is very forgiving, relaxed, and fun.  the writing assignments were easy and checked in class before being turned in, exams were take home, and completely understanding the two novels wasn't completely necessary the first time through.  i felt like i improved my spanish confidence a lot and ability without working extremely hard.

If you actually want to learn Spanish, don't take the class with this prof.  It's far too easy and he grades papers by taking points off for grammatical errors with no regard to the quality of the writing.  In other words, students who write three word sentences in present tense can get higher grades than students who take risks to write at a higher level.  Overall, far too easy.
@
Ricardo Bardo

I found this class very boring.  I did not like it at all.  I took it as a class that I would enjoy amidst my other distributive-requirement-fulfilling or required courses and did not enjoy it.  Bardo was not a hard grader nor did I hold something specific against the class, I just literally feel like nothing about my Spanish improved.  I may have learned some new vocabulary words and some tongue twisters, but nothing that improved my writing or speaking, as the course title indicates "Writing and Speaking A Cultural Approach".  I was under a very different impression of what this class would be going into it and it seems to me like the other section of the class fit that impression with Prof. Polli.  My advice if you think you can place out of this class, take the DART during orientation if you're a freshman.
@
Ricardo Bardo
/course/2839
I'm told (and believe) that Bardo is by far the easiest of the Spanish 9 profs.  The tests are the same as the other sections (but take home); the essays are very simple (you can pretty much right about anything, as long as you use correct grammar).  Basically, I worked very little, got a good grade, and learned nearly nothing.
@
Ricardo Bardo
/course/2839
This is a REC TO ALL UPPER LEVEL SPANISH COURSES, so get it over with and pad your GPA. I have to say, I worked so little in this class that I sometimes have a hard time remembering what we covered. The material was very interesting (i.e., short stories) up until the point where we started reading novels and plays. That's when the work got to be a bit too time-consuming for my taste, so I slacked off big time. But, the relatively simple class discussions (and easy although sometimes tangential and unrelated homework) made it easy to get by during class whether or not I had read the material. The grammar tests weren't always written very well, but they were all easy, AND THEY WERE TAKE HOME AND OPEN NOTE!!! The prof was very chill and very accommodating, sometimes too much so, because we often took advantage of his personality to get him to postpone, cancel, or lessen work. So, if you aren’t still suffering from senioritis, take the class, and even if you are, you can get away with the bare minimum with this prof. But don’t be mean to him. He’s a real nice guy.

This class is super easy, but the prof was a visiting prof and he had no clue what he was doing.  He's a really nice guy, but he just didn't know how to teach.  We didn't follow a syllabus, we never knew what our assignments were or when they were due, and he would randomly assign papers for the next class without any warning.  Tests were take-home, which was nice.  Class discussions were sometimes interesting, but kind of pointless because we rarely wrote about the stories we had read or the movies we had watched.

If you took AP Spanish Language & Culture in high school (and did well in it and like spanish), I think this is a good 3rd course to take. In a sense, I felt this was AP spanish lang take 2. The class is a lot of review of grammar (which is helpful as a refresher), discussions, 4 papers, and 4 orals. There is a lot of busy work (such as grammar), and there are 5 grammar quizzes over the term (hard quizzes but unlimited retakes). While I found the discussions interesting, I found it annoying that there was little connection between different class discussions. (If you missed a day of class, the content covered in a class discussion would never appear again in another class.) However, the discussions improved my speaking skills and the writings and orals are good practice of different styles/occasions of writing/speaking. If you took AP spanish and are looking for a class to refresh your spanish or are interested in a spanish major/minor, this is a good starting point. If you are taking this class after Dartmouth spanish 1, 2, and 3 (no previous spanish experience), I would make sure that you have a good base of writing skills, grammar, and speaking skills. The expectation for this class is that you know basic spanish grammar and are learning more complicated grammar, can speak about complicated topics, and can write in a sophisticated manner.

For this review, Asensio should not have been listed as the prof. She was in class for perhaps the first two weeks of the term, and then left due to her pregnancy. Francoise Gilbert was the prof for the rest of the time. She goes very slowly with the grammar material, but for readings (the more difficult work), shy flies through it. This class is definitely a step up from Spanish 2 and 3. There's a lot more reading and writing involved, and while it can still be considered a rather "easy" class, it's not a joke like the previous Spanish courses.
@
Paloma Asensio
/course/2839
Prof. Asensio had to leave after a few weeks due to her pregnancy, so the class was taken over for Francoise Gilbert. The ratings above are for Asensio. Gilbert was somewhat less effective, and she confused us a bit on some of the grammatical concepts (at times she would directly contradict what the worksheets said), but it was overall an interesting course that improved my Spanish.  The workload was good. Papers were graded more on grammar than on content. There seemed to be homework due every class, but the homework consisted mainly of grammar exercises; nothing terribly difficult. Short readings were magical realism, which I enjoyed. The movie, in my opinion, was quite interesting (make sure you watch with subtitles!). The novel was long and took forever to read. I managed to get by, though, only having read about half of it and trying to follow class discussions.  A good course overall, and an easy way to get rid of the LIT distrib.
@

This class was pretty average as far as a Spanish class goes. Some of the vocab in the readings was challenging, but Professor Asensio helps you understand the words. Class discussions were fairly interesting and you need to read because it's a small class.
@
Paloma Asensio
/course/2839
This class is a waste of time if you want to continue with Spanish grammar...there is nothing new to learn. You just read these really terrible stories and do group work in class. If you want to continue learning Spanish grammar, then just buy a workbook. Professor Asensio was ok. She was perpetually late and usually ran at of class before questions could be asked. Her feedback on compositions were not good at all and left much to be desired. She was nice but she added to the feeling that I had throughout the term that I was wasting valuable moments of my life in that class.

The readings are easy to understand, and the discussions on the literature are pretty interesting and not very stressful.   The four tests focus on vocabulary discussed in class and grammar from the vocab tests. Handouts and workbook pages are given to review the grammar.

it's fun, not too difficult, interesting, rewarding, and it renewed my desire to learn spanish.  i'm talking to you, 11s (and 12s) who placed out of spanish 3 and are done with your language requirement.  i blew off taking a spanish class my freshman year and it was in retrospect a bad decision.  i was dreading this class coming in, but it actually wasn't bad and was very rewarding.  i learned a lot of spanish and i think i'm going to continue working on my spanish because of this class.  professor asensio is approachable and very understanding.  the only tough/frustrating part of the class was the grammar... there were four or five "examenes" in class that were tough for me, but luckily they were only 5% each.  other than that the class was mostly reading stories and a novel and answering questions about them.  additionally, this class is a good way to balance out other heavy reading or problem set classes.  take it!

@

This class really helps refine your Spanish writing through essays and take-home exams. They grade essentially ENTIRELY on grammar, or at least in my class she did. This is hard for some to get used to and doesn't really support students exploring new forms of expression in Spanish. It's better for your grade perhaps to stick with the old stuff which I don't agree with. Like ending on a preposition! or not having a subject? Mrs. Asensio is a very nice and patient teacher

This course is required in order to take the higher level Spanish courses, and it is a fairly easy transition course. There is daily work, but it is always light.

The readings were good, but they could be a little dense, so I suggest reading them twice if possible.  The class seemed oriented towards discussions of sexuality and machismo mixed in with philosophical questions.  The professor seemed to challenge the class to discuss deeper issues in Spanish rather than solely focus on comprehension.

This was an amazing class.  It was much less work than a standard class, but it encapsulated what a liberal arts education should be.    There was none of that nitpicky-ness that's so characteristic of Dartmouth prof's here -- except when it came to grammar, but I thought that was great because my grammar skills improved ten-fold.  The emphasis on the "big picture" and the themes of literature seemed great to me.  I started out the term wondering what I'd gotten myself into, since I hadn't taken a Spanish class since junior year of high school, but it worked out really well.  I am a much better Spanish speaker and writer now than I ever was, even after 5'ing the AP Spanish exam -- that is how amazing Aguado is.  If you're rusty in your Spanish skills when you're entering the class, don't worry.  I think I was 100 times more worried about my skill level than Prof. Aguado was, and in the end I think his faith in my helped me improve a lot.  Take this class with Aguado.  He was randomly assigned to teach our section of the course two weeks before classes started, but this has to have been the best random assignment of a teacher I've ever gotten in my life!

This was by far my easiest class of the term.  There is very little work outside of class and the readings are fairly easy to understand, but also interesting.  Aguado is very particular about grammar, but also a fairly easy grader and a good guy.

This was an excellent course with an even more excellent prof.  I would recommend this class to anyone, it was certainly my favorite this term.  Aguado was very enthusiastic, but never in an annoying way, and extremeley helpful and passionate about helping us learn.  The material was phenomenal, and writing assessments fostered improvement but were far from overwhelming.  Definitely definitely great course, and great prof.

I took this after taking AP Spanish Lang in high school.  The readings were interesting.  The homework was minimal and pretty easy.  My favorite aspect of this course was watching different Spanish movies.  By the end of the term, we had seen 3.  Aguada is interesting and loves discussing the books and movies.  Take this class!

Wasn't a hard class.  I like Spanish Lit (and it was intro... basic compared to AP Spanish Lit).  If you got a 5 on the AP Span Lit exam, petition to pass out of this b/c I didn't and I kind of regret that.  It was pretty basic- a good transition between grammar class and reading actual spanish works.  Expository Lit.

The course itself was alright- we learned a lot in class, the material was interesting, and Aguado is one of the nicest, most helpful and most understanding professors I expect to have at Dartmouth. However, rather than doing skits or more presentations in class, I found we tended to spend a lot of time on grammar and problems people have with grammar in the material. But, by the end, my grammar in essays and on tests was much improved.
@
Joseph Aguado
/course/2839
Professor Aguado is an excellent professor; his lectures were very interesting and he makes an effort to ensure that everyone understands the material that  he is covering. Most of the class, however, was discussion based and he did a really good job of moderating the discussion.   The readings were very interesting and not too difficult; although you will almost certainly need a dictionary to get through them.   The essays were also relatively easy - you recieve a content and a grammer score and then have the option of turning in a corrected version. The tests were relatively easy (he is a very generous grader). The bulk of your grade, however, is based on your participation in the class discussions, so make sure to go to class and speak up.

Straight up, this class is easy and Polli is an awesome prof.  She's nice and understanding.  There were no exams, just once a week "vocab quizzes" where, outside of class, you wrote up 10 sentences each with a vocab word and some other condition.  There was web work, but that was no big deal.  And the pronunciation exercises weren't a problem either.  The final presentation had a lot more work involved than anything else, so don't procrastinate on that.  It makes up 20% of your grade.  Participation is huge in this class, so speak up, don't wait to get called on, and come to every class.  It's called "conversation and culture" for a reason.  TALK!

The prof for this class was actually Francine A'ness and although I have not had a class with Sprague, I was very happy for the switch. A'ness is a great prof and very helpful. This was the first spanish class in over 2 years so it was a little more difficult for me than for students coming out of spanish 3. That said, it was still managable and Prof A'ness was very willing to help students regardless of their level. If you are thinking that you might want to continue with spanish but you're not sure if you remember enough or if it will be too difficult, I would still recommend taking this class. Especially if you would want to go to Madrid.

For the most part  i liked the class. i liked our class discussions, and the novels and short stories we read, although i dont think we ever got to spend enough time on them. i liked the freedom we had with our writing topics, but i feel like the essays were usually graded too harshly--much more for grammar than analytical content, etc. the tests i also thought were pretty hard. overall, though, i liked the class, and i definitely saw an improvement in myself by the end of it.

I would certainly urge you to take a course with Professor A'ness; she is an incredible professor and was always very supportive and willing to help.

Professor A'Ness is very enthusiastic about the material she teaches.  The class is small, with a seminar-like setup, and the professor encourages as much student participation as possible, since after all we are there to improve our spoken spanish as well as to read and write better.  The reading assigned is interesting and challenging.  This class picks up right where AP Spanish left off in high school.  And there's no drill!

Ever learned Spanish from a British professor?  A'Ness is really great and is really really nice.  She's totally accessible outside of class and can respond to blitzes like no other.  She understands when the workload might be too much and changed the syllabus accordingly. Her exams were take-home and based on the Honor Principle. There were 1-page papers every other week, a group presentation, and a Final Paper.  Overall, she is a pretty good grader and truly wants her students to improve in Spanish grammar and speaking skills.  A'Ness stresses class participation-it accounts for 30% of your overall grade.   A'Ness is an excellent prof!

Professor A'ness is an amazing professor, definitely take advantage of any courses taught by her.  she's very knowledgable and friendly with an incredible enthusiasm.  she loves the language, loves the works we read, and loves working with students.  the course itself was interesting but she was just great, making this course well worth it.  you read short stories, 1 play, and 1 novel.  work consists of 2 tests, a final paper, a presentation, and 5 analysis essays (1 page each) on the readings.  the work was more than manageable, and class consisted of discussing the stories, presentations, and an occasional grammer review.  i would definitely recommend this course to anyone at all interested in Spanish, and definitely try to get Professor A'ness.  she is really fantastic.

I entered the class frightened that it would be dull and that the professor would be uninterested in this sort of introductory/survey course.  Nothing could be further from the truth!  Profesora Ana is marvellous, very engaging, animated, and extremely friendly and open to helping students.  I strongly encourage going to office hours, not that it impacts your grade at all, simply because you will enjoy it!  Course load was pretty average, consisting of just six two-page essays over the ten weeks (plus you can resubmit them after she has marked all your errors).  Tests were simple if you came to class and were awake.  If at all possible, you should take a class, any class, with this prof!

I'll never be a great Spanish student, so I didn't love this class. But it's not bad, and Dra. Diaz-Marcos brings a ton of energy to it. I feel more educated for having taken it, but I'm just not the enthusiast that a lot of the class is.

Given the material and syllabus for this class, it could easily be a dud.

She makes me want to improve my spanish just so I could talk to her more.

This course is basically an introduction to Hispanic literature.  Class consists entirely of discussion of readings, either as a class or in groups.  The readings were great - we covered a number of famous Hispanic authors, and readings were usually short stories or sections out of books, so didn't take too long to read.  The class was a lot of work though.  Besides the readings we had grammar exercises to do 2-3 times a week, which were gone over briefly in class.  Then there were weekly 1-2 page papers (reactions to readings) that needed to be revised for the next week.  There were also group presentations on aspects of Hispanic culture.  Overall it was a great class, I learned an immense amount of Spanish and got to do some great reading.  However, if you're not interested in literature and discussions of these, this class is not for you.
@

/course/2839
diaz-marcos is super understanding and also super easy.  you really don't even have to read the material 'cause she goes over it in class.  the most that is required of you is to watch videos for homework and those are interesting for the most part.  every friday the students give presentations which means the rest of the class does absolutely nothing.  you really only work the week that it is your turn to give a presentation.  but really, she is THE NICEST AND EASIEST GRADER EVER so there's not much to worry about.  as for papers, if you write a paper the morning it's due in, say, 45 minutes, you will probably get an A.  i didn't take this class with the intention of it being a gut class, but that's what it ended up being.

the class is eeeeeeeasy..... I hadn't taken spanish for 1.5 years before jumping into this class THREE WEEKS INTO THE TERM.  I caught up in a weekend by doing some grammar exercises and watching a movie... that was all I'd missed.  This is probably the easiest way ever to get a LIT distrib... the total reading probably did not exceed 40-50 pages all term.  a few grammar exercises to do, class presentations every friday (of which you do two all term).  The papers are the best - you get to redo everything, and the ONLY thing she ever marks off for is grammar and couldn't care less what you actually write ABOUT.  tests are easy too - all simple grammar and a paragraph or two to write about a movie/reading.

This is a great class to take if you are interested in continuing after fulfilling a language requirement.  The material was broad, and covered interesting topics.  The course had a good mix of writing, literature, movies, and grammer.  Prof Diaz-Marcos is awesome, she understands students, and is quite enthusiastic about the material.    The grading and exams were pretty easy, if you go to class and do the work you can get an A pretty easily.

Take this class with ANYONE else.   Lirot is unfair, often mean, and totally insensitive to the fact that you may just be taking this class to keep up your Spanish. She wants everyone to be totally in love with the evolution of Spanish grammar. I went into this class with a positive attitude and she embarrassed me and made me dislike the subject.   STAY AWAY!!!!
@
Julie Lirot
/course/2839
Very little time was spent TEACHING grammar.  She verbally added a requirement the the final paper during the final class.  Many of us had done significant work on or had even finished and had to COMPLETELY start over.  Class participation (25% of the grade) was completely on a "does she like you" scale.  Again, she's a perfectly nice person, she just shouldn't be teaching.
@
Julie Lirot
/course/2839
This class is required for all upper-level courses, so if you have to take it, you have to take it.  However, no new information was introduced in this course.  The workbook was tedious and generally not helpful.  Class discussions were limited, and often interrupted by the professor.  The quizzes could cover material that we had barely touched on in class, although even topics the professor taught were not made adequately clear before we were tested on them.  The syllabus did not always seem to match what we were learning in class.  A workbook assignment that might have taken 1-2 hours to do when it was assigned wouldn't be relevant until much later, if ever, and the professor would often assign random tasks at the end of class that were never collected or mentioned again.  Don't take the class unless you have to, and even then, if you can take it with a different professor, you might get more out of the experience.
@
Julie Lirot
/course/2839
I read reviews before taking this class that said Professor Lirot was the worst Professor at Dartmouth and to avoid her at all costs. I was happy to find these were exaggerations, but she did have some areas with room for improvement. She was lax about due dates and work in general at times, and didn't seem to be too well organized. Sometimes, during discussion, even during student presentations, she would dominate the discussion, making it hard for the students to chime in.  The workload was frustrating in that it all piled up at the same time, while at other times there was nothing to do.
@
Julie Lirot
/course/2839
the bad news is that this class is required, so if you have to take it, you have to take it. try as hard as you possibly can to take it with someone other than lirot. i plan on being a spanish major, and this class caused me to seriously doubt that decision. 25% of your grade is based on participation, which is totally based on what happened to pop into disorganized head in the first five seconds you spent with her. i'm pretty sure my spanish actually got worse last term.  i'm probably being a little bit dramatic here. i obviously survived and got a decent grade. my point is that you should try to get a different professor if you can.

When it comes to writing, Prof. Sprague takes off points for any little mistake you might have.  During class she is a bit disorganized and tends to jump from thing to thing.  She really doesn't wrap up each activity before moving on to the next.  Overall, the class is easy.
@
Paula A.
/course/2839
This was my first Spanish class at Dartmouth and overall, it was a pretty decent class. Homework was generally assigned every day but they were not time-consuming nor were they too difficult to complete. Professor Sprague makes herself available if you want to go over your papers before submitting them, which you should do since they are graded rather harshly-she takes a point off for every grammar mistake. But other than that, it is a laid-back class and as long as you put in some effort, you should do well.
@
Paula A.
/course/2839
I had varying perspectives on this class on different days. A lot of times Professor Sprague seemed to jump around a bit during class. I guess it's a product of not having a lot of time in which to cover a great deal of material, but I still felt the classes could have been organized a bit better.  Small group work, though, was often fun and gave a good opportunity to work on language skills. While reviewing grammar and doing bookwork wasn't always great fun, it's also necessary. The stories were decent, though, so they weren't too hard to get through.  One caveat papers are graded fairly though a bit strictly. I was shocked after getting my first one back, but ended up rebounding with very little trouble. Definitely take advantage of office hours when doing rewrites of the papers-Professor Sprague is open to helping and gives great direction on what needs to be fixed.

Prof. Russell's lectures were fascinating.  He made all the literature and poetry that we read come alive.

Its a good course to take if you already have strong language skills.  Roberto (the professor) is fabulous so i would defnitely recommend him if you are taking this course.  If  your language skills aren't already strong, you may feel overwhelmed and have to work harder to keep up.

This class was a great transition from lower level Spanish to more difficult topics.  The readings and class discussions were varied and interesting.  Best of all, Prof. Russell (informally addressed as Roberto during class) provided a comfortable and supportive atmosphere.  I didn't even skip class - it was that fun!  Roberto also makes plenty of time out of class for individual writing conferences which really helped me identify strengths and weaknesses in my writing.

Professor Russell is simply a wonderful man and he brings his humor and his loveable quirkiness to the class.  I'd never thought I'd have so much fun in a spanish class and Professor Russell had made it a wonderful experience for me.  Don't get me wrong.  I'm not one of those people who did super well in the class and therefore thinks the class is great.  I actually did a lot worse than I had anticipated or hoped but that was because of mistakes I made by not studying very much or doing the readings in the text book.  But, if you did all these things, you'll probably do very well in the class.  I'm writing this review because Professor Russell is hilarious and I'm so glad I took his course and got to know him.

/course/2839
Profesora Soler is definitely the worst professor or teacher I have ever had. She was unable to teach (she just assigned and tested). I learned nothing from this clas. The reading was too advanced for Spanish 9, and she made almost no effort to help us understand it. The grammar was basically all review. She did not teach us how to improve our writing, but would only mark errors, which we often had to guess how to correct, especially because she is almost never available outside of class. I received no positive feedback all term even though I spent more time on this class, especially at the beginning, than I have on any other Dartmouth course. Also, she did not set clear expectations, which was very problematic. I used to really like taking Spanish. Now I don't even really like the language anymore, and I'm really not looking forward to taking the other Spanish class I have to take. In addition, Castillian Spanish was the only acceptable dialect in this class, and she would "correct" the workbook answers to Castillian -- which is especially troubling since so many of the students in the class went on LSAs to Mexico! Luckily she was a visiting professor and is now back in Spain, though she said she would like to teach here again. If she does, do not take a class with her! Even if you have to rearrange your whole schedule, don't do it.

Alina Sokol
/course/2839
The four compositions during the term are difficult to receive good grades on, since you are docked for every single error in vocab/grammar; however, these really do help your grammar and usage skills. The two take-home exams aren't too difficult. Other than that, the readings are fairly interesting, and there is a lot of discussion in class about them. Sokol is pretty good about addressing the issues of grammar and vocab within the context of a discussion of the readings.
@
Alina Sokol
/course/2839
This class really frustrated me, but I am glad that I took it. Prof Sokol is a very hard grader when it comes to the four papers and two tests.  However, this does help the students to really see improvement in their writing.  A point is taken off for every error, so it is easy to get a very bad grade very quickly.   Prof Sokol is a very good teacher, even though sometimes she does not have the best way of explaining difficult concepts.  What frustrated me most about the class was the fact that we spent a long time learning the "exceptions" for all of the rules that we had learned in previous classes.  But this is a good thing, since it means that we really learned a lot in this class.

Roberto Rey Agudo
/course/2839
This class was super frustrating. In class, Prof Agudo was great; we practiced Spanish, talked about interesting social issues in the Spanish speaking world, and it overall was useful and enjoyable. Outside of class, however, it was a disorganized mess. We never knew what the homework was because it was often not posted/posted late on canvas (or just didn't have a due date). It also took a long time for any assignments to be returned, so I couldn't see what I'd done wrong on the last essay/recording/whatever and avoid doing the same thing again, and it was hard to understand the grades I got in the first place (we just got back confusing, vague rubrics). Overall, Prof Agudo is a great guy, and the course could be enjoyable, but it turned out to be frustrating (and I didn't learn as much as I could have) because of his disorganization. The class never felt like it was his priority on any level.
@
Roberto Rey Agudo
/course/2839
I took this class because I planned to do the LSA+, but it was my least favorite class of the term. It was manageable to do well, but the amount of work we had outside of class in comparison to what we actually discussed was annoying. Professor Agudo was really nice and this class definitely improved my speaking ability, but I would sometimes end up watching a 2-hour movie which we would discuss in class for about 15 minutes. I improved in some aspects, but more than anything this class was just a necessary evil.

Rosa is a really chill teacher, very friendly and engaging, and never got mad at my class. Often she will make some mistake uploading the homework to Canvas so you don't even have to do it. Otherwise, you can still get away with not doing any of homework because it's all discussed in class rather than checked over in any way, so by the end of the term no one really did the homework because you could just BS it in class. That being said there were a lot of assignments and earlier in the term when I actually tried to do them all, it could pile up - we'd have a few sets of exercises from the book, a few more online, and usually a 30min podcast or 2hr movie to watch and answer questions about. There were a few compositions, usually 2 pages double spaced due at midnight, and some video recordings which were pretty easy to crank out last minute. The quizzes were all online and half of the ones on the syllabus didn't even end up happening so those were super chill. However, I also don't feel like I really learned anything this term. We reviewed some grammar like subjunctive and conditional, and other pretty important things, but I didn't totally get them all by the end. So if you're going for a chill class with a lot of "optional" homework, and a nice dynamic with your teacher and classmates, hope to get Matorras - she is a really nice teacher, you just might not learn all that much.

I LOVED this class! It was definitely my favorite class of the term. Take into consideration that I love Spanish, but I also loved Professor Matorras and the class material. Professor Matorras genuinely cares about her students, and she tries hard to make each class interesting and engaging. I liked that there were less than 20 of us in the class, so we all had opportunities to speak. This class focused a lot on grammar, which I really liked since I lacked a good grammar foundation in high school. Class discussions were generally very interesting. We covered a lot of social issues in Latin America through music videos, movies, and podcasts. There were online quizzes, essays, and videos that we had to do besides the homeworks. I wouldn't call this class a layup if you genuinely want to learn. She's not going to check homeworks (which take about 2-3 hours to do), but I found that I learned a lot from doing them. Also, it was pretty clear by the end of the course who consistently kept up with work and who didn't. The quizzes, essays, and videos will take as much time as you put into them. Professor Matorras is really understanding and kind, and she gives a lot of feedback so you can improve.

We had Ricardo Bardo (what a sweet name) as the professor (not who ever the guide says...) and he was friggin sweet.  This was my first spanish class at Dartmouth and it was very similar to high school spanish class, so it was tons of fun.  Read a couple stories, wrote a few essays, 2 take home midterms and a take home final.  Easy stuff.  Fun class

Ricardo Bardo (not Isabel Lozano-Reneiblas) was a very good prof. Always listening to students, encouraging them, and teaching in every way possible, Bardo was amazing. I loved how it was a laid-back, easy-going, type class. There wasn't too much to worry about, yet we learned alot and had some nice discussions. I really hope Prof Bardo doesn't leave Dartmouth b/c he was alot of fun and a great teacher.

I only had to take Spanish 3 to finish my language requirement, but loved it so much I decided to try out 9.  I didn't expect 9 to be so much harder than Spanish 3 - it was a big jump.   Also, when the stories were difficult to understand, the prof wasn't great about explaining them, but eventually you'd have a vague idea.    Class participation counts, tests are take-home and homeworks are occassionally collected.  The final is watching a movie and writing the paper and everything is graded fairly.   Do a little work ,get a good grade.

Rosa Maria
/course/2839
I had a lot of issues with this class.  Although Rosa was really nice in class, available out of class, and took a personal interest in the lives of her students, the grading did not seem to make sense.  On the compositions (4) a point was taken off for every single grammatical mistake.  By the 3rd one, I learned that if I wrote in the most simple spanish, I'd get a better grade than if I took risks and used more complicated phrasing and structure.  This seems antithetical to an upper level course; all it taught me was to edit my papers 7 times before passing them in.  The tests have nothing to do with anything you learn in class (they're take home and easy) and the homework is never corrected, collected, or talked about so there's absolutely no point in doing it.  The other thing that really irked me was that we did barely any oral work- there was a presentation for which we could read off a paper and sometimes we talked about our weekend plans but other than that I felt like my speaking ability declined.  I took this course having returned from the LSA and found it to be a huge let down and cause of the deterioration of my spanish.  It might be just the curriculum though so Rosa isn't terrible to take it with.

Though at first I was really frustrated with the class because it was a huge jump from Spanish 3, I really liked Professor Matorras and felt that she helped the class through the transition.  While she might be strict with grammatical mistakes and such in essays, her grading and teaching really helps you improve your Spanish.

Fritz Glockner
/course/2839
This class defiently helped me improve my writting, but I still am really unsure about grammar.  Also, I did not gain a lot of confidence with my speaking.  The text book for this class was useless all it did was tell you how to write a paper as if we were in 5th grade!
@
Fritz Glockner
/course/2839
This class really helped improve my writing and speaking. We had to write a number of papers and were forced to speak daily and had one oral. This continual practice definitely helped me become more comfortable with the language.  That being said, the material being covered in class did not correspond to what we were graded on whatsoever. Whereas we mostly discussed the contents of the short stories that we were writing about, essays were only graded based on grammar, not content. What this means is that it is within the students' best interest to "dumb down" their Spanish when they write so that their grammar is perfect. This course does not encourage risk-taking because of its grading policy.  However, a considerable part of the overall grade is class participation, meaning one can easily overcome some bad essay grades. Also, the textbook is painfully boring and unnecessary because it teaches how to write - ie. stuff that was taught in middle school.   I would really only take this course if you are interested in continuing along the Spanish sequence. I was only willing to put up with the textbook and sometimes boring class discussions in hopes that more advanced Spanish classes will be more interesting.

After taking the class I can easily write papers that would be graded just as harshly in a normal writing class. The expectations are high but necessarily so. Prof. Gilbert did not seem like the professor type, in that she was not always sure about grammatical issues, however she was more than willing to work with us to figure it out. I really enjoyed the class and feel much more confident in my ability to write 5-6 page papers and presenting papers to the class.

This was the first Spanish course that I took at Dartmouth and it was wonderful.  The course provided a good balance of grammar review, literature, and essay writing.  I liked how the course began with us reviewing grammar and reading short stories and then during the second half of the quarter we read a play and a short novel.  Annabel is such a great professor and she definitely inspires interest in the subject matter.

Noelia is dope.  She is young so she understands her students.  The work is really easy if you are good at Spanish and is mostly a review of SPAN 1, 2, and 3 grammar.  The homework is tedious but you can get around doing it sometimes.  Noelia is the best prof I've had at Dartmouth so far.

Juan M.
/course/2839
What can I say?  This course has so much potential to improve your spanish proficiency, but it really didn't.  Juan can be extremely intimidating and most people in the class quickly start to dislike him early on as class is often a bore... He tries provoke conversation but that often involves putting you in VERY hypothetical situations that you can't even begin to think about (IF you had a boy/girlfriend and IF he/she danced with someone that COULD HAVE BEEN your good friend, WOULD you have gotten jealous?)  I came out of the course not having taken spanish in almost 2 years with what I felt no more proficiency in the language.  I have heard good things, however, about this course with other profs. so i'm hoping it was just the prof.  He's a very harsh grader (missing a couuple accent marks and a verb tense or two will get you a B- ) and while he lets you rewrite every paper, it's very little incentive as it's very difficult to improve more than a fraction of a letter grade.

Spanish 9 was a very easy course. The material is quite basic and the textbook was easily good enough to explain it without ever going to class-- participation counts though.

Spanish 9 is a good transition course if you're coming from high school spanish.  My writing skills have improved tremendously, but not really because of the course.  I just have learned a lot of new constructions and words from kids in class.  Prof. Rodriguez is the nicest, most understanding prof- I had a lot of extenuating circumstances during a week where the work load was very high, and he was great about it.  On the other hand, i felt that he made up class as he went along a lot of the time.  Though I'm overjoyed with my grade, I think it's pretty arbitrary.  Speaking is not worked on at all, which is unfortunate.  My speaking has probably deteriorated.  if you're worried about diving right into 37, I recommend you take 9 first to get your writing skills up to par.

Go to his office hours and he'll help you a ton. Super nice guy.

Pretty standard lecture class, not bad but not standout either. Carey is definitely part of the better half of lecturers at Dartmouth. Lots of reading but it's possible to succeed. You can get a C/B on the tests with a medium amount of studying but you'll have to work for the A.

Extremely interesting class with a very knowledgable and effective professor. Pay attention in lecture, because concepts from the reading are explained with clarity and detail, and that it exactly what the exams are on. Professor Carey gives pop quizzes on the reading which are pretty much reading comprehension— should be fine if you do the readings all the way through and take a few good summarizing notes. However, you have to show up on time to every single class to avoid missing one. It is not at all an easy class, you have to work hard, but it's worth it.
@
John Carey
/course/1450
A pretty good class overall. There's a lot of reading but it is generally quite interesting. Carey gives 8 pop quizzes to test for attendance/comprehension but he only ended up giving 7 this term and at least half of them were in the first few weeks, plus he drops the lowest grade. Generally, pop quizzes and exams only test for main ideas, so you would probably get along fine if you have the faintest idea of what's going on. Carey gave great overview of democracy around the world and factors that can sustain/hinder it and he was very willing to talk after class too. Readings are mostly academic papers/books by other political scientists. Would recommend even for non-gov majors. There's a course paper due at end of the term that I would not recommend leaving to the last minute.

I enjoyed this class a lot, largely because of Professor Carey. He is always willing to meet with students outside of class, to answer questions in class, and to break up the monotony of a lecture with a few jokes here and there.   Class structure There are readings due every class, and each week, there is a pop quiz on the readings. The lectures also follow after/summarize the readings. TLDR DO THE READINGS. They are long and sometimes tedious, especially if you are writing notes on them, but hard work will pay off in Carey's class.

Very interesting and profound class that will shift the way you think about and consider politics. Prof. Carey is a very nice and friendly guy who is very fair about grading and assignments.

Pop-quizzes are abundant but easy. Take it if it sounds interesting to you.

Course I learned a ton in Gov 4, but most of it was from the readings and not the lectures.  Professor Most of the lectures consisted of a couple kids in the front of the class asking some off topic questions and Prof. Carey answering them. There wasn't much in the way of any lecture. On a side note, he also gave pop quizzes, which got really annoying.  Workload The reading was inconsistent at times. It nonetheless was a relatively fair amount each night and didn't impede any progress in other subjects. Studying for exams was another matter. Rather than drawing from class lectures, Prof. Carey based his exams almost exclusively on the readings. In order to do well, one had to more or less memorize each paper's arguments and some of its specifics. I found this very infuriating. Though studying wasn't hard, it ended up taking awhile and ate into a lot of my time.  Nonetheless, Gov 4 is certainly worth it if you're willing to put in the time. You will learn a ton and will view the world in a different way. I recommend taking this course with Carey and Gov 5 with Brooks or Wohlforth if you want to be able to understand comparative and international politics really well.

The lectures and readings go downhill as the term rolls on.  Carey regurgitates the readings in his lectures, making the readings especially tedious, but still needed because of his eight pop quizzes.  The final was pretty hard and pulled from some obscure sections of the course.  Take this course if you need it.  If not, skip it and save yourself the bore of the readings and lectures.
@
John Carey
/course/1450
The class didn't seem so bad at first 2 op-eds (which can be handed in anytime before the last day of class), 5-8 random pop quizzes, 2 midterms, and a final. The 2 op-eds were pretty easy and the quizzes made the readings and attendance mandatory. But the lectures were, unfortunately, basically a reiteration of the readings. This made the lectures almost excruciating, but necessary to attend since the quizzes are worth 20% of your grade.  The quizzes were pretty straightforward. If you'd done the readings the night before, you should be fine. The tests, however, were way too detailed and they seemed to get even more detailed as the term progressed. The final, which Carey claimed would be heavily based on material covered after the midterms, was especially nitpicky.  Overall, only take the course if you need it.

I find it interesting that there seems to be a lot of negative feedback.  I had heard nothing but great reviews for Carey, and I had a very favorable impression.  He gives dynamic lectures, and a lot of the readings were interesting.  Then again, there was A LOT of reading.  Most people did not get it all done, but as long as you skim the readings you should do ok on the pop quizzes.  I am not exactly sure how I feel about the grading.  I did surprisingly well on the first few assignments, but the later ones (which I thought I did well on) I got much lower grades.  But the class was overall very interesting, and I am now considering a minor in government.
@

The only way to really be prepared for Carey's tests are to reread every single article assigned and memorize every minute detail. His questions are unfair and he is also a very picky grader.  His lectures do not help understand the material and are not heavily tested on. The lectures are usually long tangents about an esoteric part of the reading. Going over the powerpoints is not a helpful way to study for the class.  I would recommend taking Gov 4 with a different prof, Carey is confusing and nitpicky.

This class is a pretty typical intro class. You do the reading, listen to Carey talk, and memorize facts for two midterms and the final. The material is interesting enough, though his lectures could easily have been more effective.  I feel as if we spent more time studying from the reading and our own notes than his lectures. He also has a habit of letting student questions dominate the class and getting off track. However he is a very caring and friendly prof, and the class can be as good or as bad as you make it. If you have an interest in the subject or need it for your major it is not that bad.

Carey is a really nice, engaging professor.  The class is broken up into several sections, all of which deal with different aspects of government that relate to the broad questions of the course what are the ideal conditions for democracy? is democracy the best form of government? There is also a section on electoral systems and voting methods.  While the readings are all interesting, they are at times quite dense--many are studies that involve a lot of statistics that could be a bit overwhelming--and there can be up to 90 pages of reading from a Monday to Friday class. Carey also used a lot of the x-hours at the beginning of the term but expected us to read the same amount, even though we had only a day to do 30-50 pages of reading.  And you have to do the reading. Carey gives pop quizzes on the readings that are difficult and DETAILED. They also prepare you for the exams, however, so take them seriously. They make up a significant portion of your grade, so you can only afford to really mess up one out of the nine or so you get (you can drop your lowest score).  The course has two midterms, both of which have a multiple choice section and one-three essays. The multiple choice section has some broad concept questions mixed in with some VERY detailed questions that require you to have thoroughly read the articles.  The final is cumulative but weighted towards the end of the class and is slightly longer than the two midterms.  You're also required to write two 750 word Op-Eds by the end of the term (you can turn them in whenever). Because of the extremely short word limit these can actually be pretty challenging because you have to come up with an argument and support it convincingly in about 3 pages. However, they force you to apply what you're learning about theoretical things (like the collective action problem) to real-life politics and I really enjoyed writing them.  Carey's a nice prof but a stickler for details and word limits. You have to work hard but you learn a LOT.

Prof. Carey is at times a disorganized lecturer, and I thought he spent too much time answering and discussing students questions - sometimes as much as 75% of the class.  However he does a really good job of explaining the critical points of a reading, and encouraging students to think critically about the readings.

Why Democracy is Best  Ridiculous premise to teach a course of democracy on. The main focus of other governments looked at was how they were inferior to democracy and half of the other governments were different forms of democracy.  Quizzes were ridiculously detailed. Tests included obscure and non-vital facts from the reading.  I hope your opinion meshes with Carey's on the Op-Eds. Because he'll knock you points if he disagrees.  Hopefully someone else will be teaching this course soon.

Standard intro course.  The readings were very interesting and followed a logical progression, but Prof Carey's lectures did not add much to what we read before class.  Would have attended class less frequently had it not been for the 8 pop quizzes that counted for 25% of the grade.    Carey is very responsive to students during class and, as a result, the discussion often strays from the topic at hand.  Could have done a better job at structuring his lectures.  Bottom line interesting readings, but prof could have been better.

Professor Carey is great at what he does. He truly loves the subject matter and is always willing to answer questions. He's an incredibly nice guy and goes out of his way to help students out.  That being said, here's some info about the course   Prof. Carey likes to give pop quizzes (between 6 - 8). Although most people didn't like the quizzes, they served as a motivation to do the assigned readings and not fall behind. With the exception of one quiz (the one right after Thanksgiving recess), all of the quizzes were fairly easy if you had read the material.   The material itself was mostly interesting. Although some of the articles that we read in class got repetitive at times, they kept my attention. Only one of the required readings, Shepsle and Bonchek's Analyzing Politics, was dry, boring, and dense. Fortunately, Carey explained the material in that book extremely well. I also really liked the fact that the material developed as the course progressed. Each reading led in to the next reading very smoothly. I felt that the course was very well designed.  The midterms and final are a pain to study for because there is so much material covered in the class. Fortunately, Carey posts all of his lectures online and you can use them as your main study tool. Most of the questions on the exams are fair, but sometimes he'll ask you to recall random tidbits of information that are pretty irrelevant to the course material. Each exam includes a short answer (multiple choice) component and an essay or two. The exams aren't too hard if you study for a few hours the day before.  Professor Carey asks his students to submit two Op-Eds at any point during the course. I HIGHLY recommend turning the first one in early so that you can see what he looks for (he'll write comments). You can write about almost any topic or country (as long as it involves politics outside of the US).  All in all, this class with Professor Carey was excellent. It was my favorite class this term and I definitely recommend it to majors and non-majors alike.

Taking this class senior fall was a big mistake.  Perhaps it would have been interesting had I not been familiar with the material, but as it was, Carey bored me out of my skull.

Carey is great. Clearly very knowledgeable in the subject, and very enthusiastic. Readings were long at times, occasionally several hours a night, but are interesting and Carey makes them relevant to the bigger picture. Lecture are very worth attending, and (very easy) pop reading quizzes are a part of your grade so you kinda have to. Exams aren't too hard if you've been keeping up with the class, and the two op-ed essays can be turned in at any point throughout the term, which is nice. An interesting class, definitely take it with Carey if you get the chance.

The material and readings for this class are interesting and fun to do but only if you are intersted in comparative politics.  If you don't like comparative politics this is not a good class for you. Readings are relatively long for an intro class, and you have to do them very carefully because there are pop quizzes on the readings and questions are relatively picky.    Lectures are ok - sometimes better than othres - there is a tendency for lectures to only be explanations of the readings which can be boring sometimes.
@

Yes, it's a dry intro course, and it's inevitably going to be boring but honestlly Carey did a good job with this considering the size of the course too.  I appreciated that Carey ran the course more like a 'big kid' govie class with lots of article readings and not a ridiculous 'comparative politics' textbook or whatnot.  He's very willing to help you learn the material, very available outside of class, he responds to blitzes quickly. He's a great guy and I hope to take more courses with him.  Oh, the reading quizes, these are very annoying but if you DO the reading and show up you'll be fine. these reading quizes count for 25 % of the grade!! so watch out!

Alright, I feel kind of bad giving this class such a bad review because Carey as a person isn't a bad guy. He's friendly-ish, never yells or anything like that (brings candy on halloween, plays music clips someitmes)... but MY GOD. I honestly can't say I was really interested in anything he had to say after the first class or two. He seems really energetic at first, but then you realize that he's actually rambling about things that don't make anything in the readings clear. And the readings, mind you, are pretty bad (except for Zakaria -- which was pretty good, but everything goes downhill from the first 2 classes or so). Also, I don't really think this class, in terms of material, is at all interesting... it's all theory-based, which I wasn't expecting, making it all VERY DRY and rather hard to grasp. He also brought in a lot of game theory type stuff which I really didn't sign up for...  So Carey seems nice (though he's one of those really exact by-the-book types with a bit more of an edge)... but I never managed to stay entirely awake in any of his lectures. Also, he gives POP QUIZZES on the reading which is REALLY BAD because you can't fall behind at all... and frankly I thought they were sometimes really annoying about stupid details that I couldn't remember because  I read all the material at 3 AM etc... (come on, I know you'll do that a few times too). The 2 midterms weren't terrible but they're a PAIN TO STUDY for because Carey's lectures are useless, his Power Points suck (as in, can't serve as viable study aids), so basically you have to figure out what it is you want to remember from all the baaaaaaaad reading you have to do. The final for our section was much tougher than I expected (the other section got off easier on the essay apparently) and I didn't really feel like the effort I put into the class helped me out. You have to write 2 Op-Eds by the end of term, which aren't tooo bad, but are annoying anyway because the information needed to write them is hard to aquire if you're not extremely well-informed about all foreign countries.  bottom line, if you KNOW FOR SURE you want to major in gov, and you really don't want to take one of the other Intro's, I guess you could take this class, but be prepared you might not dislike it as much as I did, but I can tell you that I didn't know anyone who liked it a lot, loved it or felt inspired by it. If you're not sure about gov, spare yourself the trouble. I wasn't too sure about my major so I guess this class helped me realize I'm not interested enough to take a crappy intro and move onto the great upper classes (which are really good). I got a B, which I'm reallllly happy with considering how badly I thought I did on the final... All in all, I don't recommend this class... at all.

prof carey is very energetic, but hes very small and likes the material he teaches  the opeds he has you write are a pain though, but his tests are pretty easy and he is a pretty lenient grader  he gives 5-8 pop quizes a term...it forces you to go to class and ensures that you do the reading  most of the material can be learned from the readings alone

The course was very interesting. I loved the assigned readings, and felt that Carey really knew what he was teaching. At times, however, he can be quite boring. I found myself falling asleep numerous times. He is a smart and interesting guy, but he is one of the most unenthusiastic people I have ever met. He drones on and on in lecture so if you have ADD dont take this course. If you want to take an interesting course but don't really care about interacting in lecture, take this class. The only other thing that sucked was pop quizzes. I guess it is Carey's way of making sure people come to his lectures because otherwise I would have skipped every class. You can easily get by just by doing the reading.

Prof Carey is exceedingly knowledgable on the subject. Interesting approach to a course with a huge subject base. Difficult, but manageable. The lectures can get boring and some of the "number based" articles were annoying, but in general a worthwhile class.

If you are interested in government, this is a great course. Professor Carey makes the subject fun with interesting lectures and reading. He focuses on broad ideas about government and types of political systems, with a few case studies of particular countries, but mostly with broad comparisons across countries. The reading is relatively long but interesting. In class, Professor Carey does an excellent job explaining the ideas and inviting discussion.

This course ought to be restructured so that government systems are studied in the contexts of particular countries rather than in a general sense.  Prof. Carey is enthusiastic about the subject matter, however his lectures raised many questions and answered very few.  The course discouraged me from pursuing a government major.

the reading is so boring that i would fall asleep after reading the first page. It would have been an okay class if there weren't annoying pretentious people who would raise their hands and offer their "brilliant" ideas. Unfortunately, their brillant ideas were actually really worthless and only ended up wasting class time and taking over the  class. So instead of having the prof teach, we had stupid kids voice their stupid opinions.

Don't take this class if you have trouble writing under time constraints. Also, if you don't have a good background in world history and politics, you'll be seriously lost in this class. The prof was ok, but his lectures not great. Also, the readings are terribly boring, with some exceptions. The class was organized in a terrible way, and at the end I feel like I've learned close to nothing.

/course/1450
This course started off with some tough readings to help you get the basics of comp govt, but once it got to the articles part (the second half) it really got interesting as you applied the basics. Professor Carey is a lively lecturer and very accessible and helpful outside of class. If you can make it through the first few weeks and stay on top of your work, it's a pretty solid intro class. Don't take it if you're not going to stay on top of your weekly reading, because there are 5-8 pop quizzes throughout the term.

John Carey is a great guy, just not the best professor. The ORC description does not really match the class. A lot of random readings. The class is quite unstructured. Prof is available  outside of class to help, but isn't always very helpful at all. He means well, just isn't that effective. Class time was often spent hearing students talking instead of the prof. When he did lecture however, he was good.
@

The course was ok, but very dull at times.  Many of the readings were extremely dense and long.  I just feel like more interesting homeworks could have been found. That being said, professor carey did a good job making the classes themselves enjoyable.  He is very animated, excited about the subject, and funny. So even if you think you may be bored with this subject matter, I would definitely suggest taking a class from carey.

I was hoping to take comparative politics to get an overview of different political systems all over the world.  But this course was instead based on what defines democracy and what conditions will best help a democracy survive.  There was some economic understanding involved and because I have never been near an econ class I found it to be more diffiult than it should have been.  I fell asleep most classes because I did not find the material interesting at all.
@

/course/1450
A solid review of the state of world political thought.  Instead of making a "grand tour" of the world and reveiwing every country's individual governemnts, Carey instead takes a more theoretical approach...discussing things like how best to institute democracy, why democracy is good, etc.  If you're interested in the governments of individual contries, take this course with a different prof.   Carey is a solid lecturer, although he can get boring.  Lectures usually just reviewed the reading of the previous night.

The class is very well structured with lots of outside reading.  The majority of the readings deal with specific problems in the world, or deal with specific events and prior knowledge of those events will make the class easier.

Carey is a great prof--he's extremely enthusiastic about the class, which really made going to class worthwhile. He would let students interrupt his lectures to answer their questions, which he did very effectively.  Carey was available outside of class and was happy to help students.  As far as work, the course is reading-intensive, but the readings are informative. To succeed in the class, one must most definitely do all the readings.  There were unannounced quizzes on the readings. They comprised the only slight negative of the course--they often did not effectively test whether one had read the material. Sometimes the quiz questions were obscure, sometimes ambiguous. However, over the course of the term, they improved a lot after students complained. The quizzes at the end of the term were much more fair, so this won't be a problem for other terms.  Carey is a great prof and just a really nice guy who cares about his students. His lectures are really enthusiastic and often he injects humor into them. Carey turns what otherwise could be a dull topic into a really interesting course. I highly recommend taking this course!
@
John Carey
/course/1450
Professor Cary is a really  nice guy and really wants his students to do well in his class, but he is not really an effective lecturer. The lectures were basically summaries of the material that we read the night before. He would often try to stimulate discussion in class, but people would just get into arguements over silly things. I don't really feel like I have a good understanding of the concepts and ideas, because his lectures were so poor.   The test was fairly easy - it was an in-class essay exam. If you read the readings or attend class, then you will probably do fine on the exam.

The class was awful, but Prof. Carey is a great prof. Unfortunately he has no control of class discussions and often wouldnt finish his lectures because of this. He didnt know how to ignore students in class or not answer personal questions (these are what office hours are for). When he was able to lecture without interruption he was an unbelievable professor- charasmatic, funny, smart, and effective. Perhaps it was just this group of students that made the class awful. It was also a lot more theoretical than I would have liked. I feel like it should be called "comparative theories" and not "comparative politics." i know little about "comparative politics" now at the end of the course.

carey just summarized the reading every time without adding any new insight, so going to class was useless, except for the fact he always had pop quizzes, so you had to go and just sit there bored out of your mind. and it's not like you can not do the readings either, since 1. he's got the pop quizzes and 2. his lecture notes are insufficient for the exams.  the actual material was pretty interesting, and the class wasn't too hard. overall, i liked it.

This class was better than I expected for a fairly large intro class. In a class of 50, Prof Carey knew almost everyone's name and encouraged questions and comments. Carey is animated, knowledgeable, and  funny. He knows his stuff, and always tried to make lectures interesting. He was honest with us in admitting certain readings would be dry or difficult, and the workload isn't bad at all.  There is an online essay test midterm and final, one 5 page paper, a hw assignment, and 5-8 quick 5 question pop quizzes, none of which are that difficult.  Overall, it was a great class to take freshman fall.
@
John Carey
/course/1450
the material covered was usually pretty interesting. however, the lectures weren't as effective as they could have been and the organization of the class is NOT country by country comparison but the different elements/stages of democracy and brief discussions of how several countries behave in the democratic paradigm. some of the readings are really monotonous and technical (lots of statistics, graphs, charts) and are difficult to understand unless you take the time and effort to understand them. i went into the class with a general interest in government already, so the topics were interesting. but the work takes patience and the assignments aren't cake. there's also reading quizzes. take if you're interested in the topic and like reading a lot. the prof's a great guy who knows his material.
@

Overall this was a good intro survey class. At times it seemed like we were trying to cover too broad of a topic and it might have been helpful to have more background for each unit and more examples to put the articles we read into context. Professor Carey was fair and helpful, though his lectures were pretty standard and basically just went through the material without really adding anything to what we had already read. Still, a class worth taking if you need an intro gov class.

This class is terrible. The professor has no concept of time management and is unable to inspire any interest with his lectures.  While he seems like a really nice, friendly guy, he can't teach his way out of a paper bag.  The lectures are merely rehashes of the readings (which by themselves are interesting), making the professor seem totally condescending as he basically reads to us the article we just read.  But he gives about 7 pop quizzes on the readings over the course of the term, meaning you have to do all the readings and come to class or you'll fail quizzes a complete waste of time. Carey lets obnoxious front row students ask too many questions that should be saved for office hours, and often the class is steered away from relevant subject matter into pointless discussion. Overall the class was easy, but don't waste your time.
@
John Carey
/course/1450
Problems with the class were that some of the readings were not interesting. I am not sure why some of them were assigned. We focused heavily on constitutions, democracies, and legislatures and I had not expected that when I thought about taking the class. Prof. John Kerry was enthusiastic and funny but the readings assigned were generally dull.  Also, the class discussion was sometimes dominated by a few people and that made it hard for me to follow what was being said. I would have preferred there to be more lecture and less discussion in such an introductory class.  The amount of reading was good. I did not feel swamped with work and the work was less than it was for my other classes.

Baldez's lectures were disorganized and ineffective, she also tries to cover too much information in very little time but I guess that's a given since this is an intro class.  I'm also not sure what multiple choice questions were doing on her exams, it seemed that she was trying to avoid correcting short answer/essay questions but ended up giving students credit for some multiple choice questions because of the confusing wording.  I'm sure Baldez is great at teaching classes about Latin America though, since that's her speciality, but Gov4 just isn't the class for her.
@

If you're looking for a relatively easy A and/or a light third class, this is the one for you. There are three exams and one final paper, all of which are very straightforward and simple. The exam materials come straight from the textbook and slides. The same goes for the essay the professor clearly states that she does not want any outside research, so all the information you need is in the material covered in class. To top it off, all these assignments are graded very, very leniently.   Having said that, if you want to learn things from a knowledgeable and effective teacher, don't take this class. This professor is incredibly underprepared and disorganized. On more than several occasions, Prof. Baldez would apologize for her lecture slides omitting relevant material, being outdated, confusing names and dates, etc., because she had "just made the slides last night." On the night before the first midterm, she blitzed the class to say that she had forgotten to include, on the syllabus, an article that she had put on the midterm. This class is not only disorganized but also, simply, boring. Prof. Baldez's lecture consists solely of her reading the slides word for word and summarizing the textbook.   All in all, I would recommend this class for non-majors who are simply looking to fill their distribs. But if you're a major interested in comparative politics, don't take this class because it's bound to disappoint. There's got to be other professors who teach the subject much more effectively.

Lisa Baldez is a very nice lady.  She is fun to talk to and has a great way with students.  I'm sure she's lots of fun at parties.  However, I felt that the course material was of a higher quality than her teaching allowed.  Her lectures often summarize the text of the book (in ways that don't always make it more clear, but usually more fun and interesting), and she often has a hard time answering the many questions students inevitably have in a class that attempts to summarizes the domestic political forces of 8 or so countries in 10 weeks.  Sometimes it was bad enough to make me question her scholarship.  As far as the grades go, there is a mid-term, a paper, pop-quizzes (of which you drop the lowest grade), and a final.  The midterm and final are full of moderately hard to soft-ball questions that she grades extremely leniently (I got full credit for a question answered objectively wrong on more than one occasion).  Read the book and you'll be safe in the 90s percentage-wise. The quizzes are 5 questions, one of which is your name; the rest are split between multiple choice and single-word or very short answer.  The timing of the quizzes is fairly easy to predict and they just focus on the major parts of the readings you had to do the night before (when you're done reading the articles, ask yourself what the big questions are; those will be the quiz questions).  The paper is short and easy to do, although Baldez demonstrates in a grading exercise she makes everyone do, her ineptitude when it comes to grading often mistaking bad writing for good, and valid points for invalid ones.  Grading here is a crap-shoot, just sound intelligent and you'll do fine.  Of the government classes I've taken so far, this is one of the most interesting in terms of subject matter.  On those grounds, I would recommend it except to freshmen who haven't taken other government classes (I don't want you guys to think Baldez's style is normal for the department)

Gov. 4 is an easy intro class.  There is very little work 2 tests consisting entirely of mc and short answer, and three 3 page papers.

I would like to take an upper level course with her where she isn't constrained by the material.

After so many positive experiences with the government department, I really felt like Professor Baldez did a bad job with teaching this class.  Although she chose interesting readings, she could have taught them better and covered more material.  She is very into class participation to the point that many people in the class talk more than she does- we definitely wasted a ton of time in this class that could have been used learning more or explaining the existing material in a better manner (for example, instead of just stating the types of things that are in articles describing the actual articles).  I felt like this was definitely a class for non-majors and was really quite bored.  I would suggest waiting for another teacher before taking this class.

I think Professor Baldez would be AMAZING in a smaller class on a more focused topic.  She learned everyone's name in a class of 50 students and placed a strong emphasis on discussion.  That said, teaching intro classes is more about distilling information than having discussions that can get ridiculously off-topic in such a large class.  I recommend Baldez but I would look at 4 with that caveat---don't use it as your judge of comparative politics.

Professor Baldez's teaching style is a self-proclaimed Oprah style. She likes calling on people to give opinions and opening up subjects for discussion in a lecture hall.

Her grading was pretty easy, the assignments were good, and eventually she knows everyone in the class. If you enjoy talking politics every few days I recommend this class, but its quite a lot of discussing with your classmates not just the prof.
@

This course is probably a really good basics class for comp. gov majors, but not a great choice for a first gov class. Prof. Baldez tries to school her students in all the classics and basics of comp gov, books that all the other gov authors refer to, etc. However, if comparative gov isn't the love of your life, this can get pretty boring. Over the course, the only questions we really addressed were When does democracy work, Why don't Arab countries democratize, and How is gov't related to gender equality. We read several books and articles, all on those themes. A background in stats would be a big help in this class, as most of the authors rely on statistical analysis. Prof. Baldez is very engaging and fun in lecture, but gets easily distracted and goes off-topic. She also has an annoying habit of keeping students in class 3-5 minutes late- kind of disrespectful, but a trade-off since class usually doesn't really start until 5-10 minutes after it should.

My best advice is to copy the lecture notes from blackboard before the class and then fill them in, b/c she goes too fast to write everything by hand.  The first midterm took 10 minutes to complete and all her tests seem like rather arbitraty surveys of random in class topics.

This course was pretty basic.  The readings and class lectures didn't always line up in the most logical ways (at least until Professor Baldez at some point decided to go over the readings for entire periods towards the end of the course - boring).  If you reviewed the essential readings and the bolded words in the text book, you were pretty solid for the quizzes.  The powerpoint style of teaching was at times a bit much, as you'd barely have time to just copy down the bullets up, and you'd miss her comments which fleshed them out (of which there were many - Professor Baldez is a very knowledgable and effective prof.).  The essay prompts were very effective and really encouraged distinct views on the evidence, as opposed to clearly fishing for the same repitition 50 times over.  Also, the case studies the course utilized were interesting and fairly in depth.  Overall, a good course, easy but never tedious or too boring.
@
Lisa Baldez
/course/1450
Professor Baldez taught this course a bit lopsidedly She spent too much time on Marx and Locke at the beginning, and at the end much of the class was frustrated and confused about the true meat of the course the different methods of comparison in comparative politics (structural, institutional, and cultural).   She often seemed unprepared for her lectures and quite often commented on how she wrote her PowerPoints late the night before or that very morning, and it showed when she would randomly say â€œoh, woops, I should delete that slide.â€ Although the in-class discussions were insightful at times, often it seemed that she was just trying to fill time, as her lectures rarely lasted the entire class period. When the lectures did take the entire class period, however, it was often because she had spent too much time with creative class-participation exercises at the beginning of class and was thus rushed to get to the real material at the end, causing only further confusion and frustration. The tests and essays were overall fair, and although the detail asked for in the first quiz was a bit of a surprise (there were multiple choice, fill in the blank, and short answer, as opposed to the multiple-choice-only practice quiz), I found the quizzes (2 in total, each worth 7.5%) to be a fair test of reading and lecture knowledge. However, her essay grading (2 essays, a Locke/Marx essay worth 20% and an essay on Mexican democratization worth 15%) to be inconsistent, as she was very critical on the first essay and much more relaxed on the second. The essay grading exercise (in which we took one essay from the stack and made comments on it, gave it a grade, and gave it to the teacher to give back to the student) was helpful in looking at different strategies of approaching the topic, and it helped that our comments didnâ€™t affect the grade she gave the essay.  She also had us go to any IR/Comparative politics-related lecture and write a 2 page, double-spaced critique (worth 10%). This was also a useful exercise that got, especially freshman, to go out and see some of the amazing lectures and debates Dartmouth holds free for students and the local community.   The final was worth 35% and was not very long, with about 35 total questions (multiple choice, fill in the blank, define terms), and a long essay comparing all of the case studies we had done. I found that I actually understood the case studies better after that test, so Iâ€™d say it was well-written.  Itâ€™s a decent class, and a good alternative to govt 6 (political philosophy) for a pre-requisite to the major, although Baldez sometimes babied us too much (taking attendance while not counting participation for a grade, making us sign in our essays when our essays already had our ID number on them) and showed a clear liberal leaning. Iâ€™m liberal, but even I got tired after a while of her talking about womenâ€™s rights, wishing she would have had a wider variety of examples. Nonetheless, Iâ€™ve heard her Latin American Politics and Gender class is very good and better suits her style and knowledge.

Pretty good for an intro class. I was a little disappointed that we spent so much time on Locke and Marx in a way that wasn't really necessary for the scope of the course.  As a result our discussions of the case studies were  limited.  I felt that we didn't really get to the meat of the course until the last two weeks which was completely inadequate. Overall Baldez is a good prof and would be great if she did a better job allocating time in the syllabus.

when sa'adah is on topic she's really good at breaking down a topic and explaining it in a way that makes marx seem way easier than he does when you read it.  she's experienced at explaining theory and you can tell she knows exactly how students can get confused  but she digresses...a lot.  which can be annoying sometimes  the paper assignments seem easy because they're short but it actually becomes a huge exercise in editing because you have to fit so much information in such little space, and it wasn't really until the end of the course and the final that i understood how all the material fit together.  she needs more organization, but is incredibly intelligent, knows her stuff, and will tell you when she doesn't

This is probably one of the worst classes I've taken at Dartmouth. Simply put, it covered way too much material - it was impossible to keep up with the readings and Professor Sa'adah's lecture style was disorganized and difficult to follow. Professor Sa'adah is nice (in a rather patronizing, I'm-really-just-a-lot-smarter-than-any-of-you -and-I-KNOW-it kind of way), but she is a ridiculously subjective grader (...despite the fact that she uses a four page "grading rubric" for papers). And while she claims to value brevity and precision in prose, she is longwinded beyond all sense and reason. She uses no visual aids in her lectures (though she occasionally writes random, tangentially-related things on the board), so keeping up is generally a problem. As is staying awake.   Fortunately, going to/paying attention in class proved to be 95% irrelevant to anything grade-related. Unfortunately, the reading was excessive to the point of laughable.   On the bright side, I have now read an entire 800 page textbook on the political systems in 10 different countries Too bad I can't get back the three weeks of my life I spent alone with that miserable book in the basement of the library.   Moral of the story do not take this class. But if you really want to make your life a living hell for 10 weeks, at least take it with Carey.

I think people have pretty different opinions about the course but I really liked it. Saadah is very knowledgeable and you can get a great deal out of office hours (there weren't many office hours, though). The essays weren't easy but you if do the readings and go to class I think you'll be okay.   I think going to this class really helps you decide whether you'll want to major in govt. Or not P

Prof Sa'adah is great...lectures are organized and concise.  She is happy to spend time with students outside of class to help them understand the material and improve their writing.    There were no tests in the course, but we had 3 relatively short papers.  She has very high standards with writing, so expect to spend a lot of time on these assignments.

Prof. Anne Sa'adah is a tough grader. There is no question about that. However, she is also interesting, witty, and extremely intelligent. Her class, consequently, reflects that.  I was both challenged and engaged the entire time I was in class. Although my grade was low, I can say that Prof. Sa'adah's class is a must for any student that wants to learn about the world we live in through insightful per-nation analysis and deep, philosophical reflection.  Be warned The class is DIFFICULT, fast-paced, but enjoyable!

Professor Sa'adah made this class excellent.  She lectured quickly but effectively and inspired interest in the course.  The course itself is far too much work, but all of it was not necessary.  You can get by without doing all of it.  This was an excellent class, in large part because of Professor Sa'adah.

Prof Sa'adah is great at delivering lectures. She's lively and very interested in the material. The readings were very interesting but far too numerous. There is no way you could get all the assigned reading done. My one objecion is that she is a very odd grader. She seems to be obsessed with writing style. Your papers will be graded more on how you wrote not what you wrote. Still she is an amazing lecturer.

Prof Saadah taught a challenging and enriching class that inspired me to major in government and concentrate in comparative politics.  The knowledge and critical thinking skills given by the class were excellent preparation for higher level comparative politics classes, as well as interesting and very worthwhile in their own right.  This course stays away from a memorization of different types of systems, and concentrates instead on understanding the dynamics of politics under certain levels of political development.  I would strongly recommend this class for anyone with an interest in development or in world events.

Sure, it's not the easiest prof in the government department, but then again it's not your usual government course.  Sa'adah is a great professor, interesting, brilliant, engaging in and out of class. She speaks her mind even when it offends students, and she is usually very entertaining.  Sure, its a little harder than most classes, but it is really and truly INTERESTING, which is a rare find.  Highly recommended.

Sa'adah is awful. I switched the course of my major to avoid more classes with her. The only reason I didn't join the hoardes of people who dropped the class after the miserable first day (when she announced her policy of pop quizzes, mandatory attendence, and her intention to make the median grade a C) was that i needed this class to go on the government FSP. The reading is insane, irrelevant, boring, and frequently highly theoretical (think Hegel and Weber). Sa'adah's only comments on the assignments (which were highly dictated by ridiculously low word limits) involved helpful phrases such as "sloppy prose!" or "regulation margins??". Don't take this class with Sa'adah if you can help it.
@

/course/1450
This class was nothing like what I had expected. Don't let the intro course number fool you... The class consisted mostly of upperclassmen and required ridiculously advanced writing capability. I wish I had waited a couple of years to take the course (but if I had to do it again, I would not have taken it.)  The class was concentrated on different political cultures and how they changed. The topic by itself was interesting enough, but we covered SO many different systems and cultures that I felt it was very rushed and we did not get to explore any topic as near as in-depth as the professor expected of us in our papers. The professor would also often divert onto irrelevant, dry tangentical topics that did little to enlighten is on comparative politics.  There is an insane amount of reading to do, and the essay prompts are difficult because they are very vague and do not provide an argument to begin with, and also because you are expected to analyze and form an in-depth argument with a very very very limited word count.
@
M. Anne
/course/1450
Comparative politics may be a great subject, but last time I checked it was part of the government department, not the English department.  If you want a professor who irks away from having to be a scholar by labeling each paper with the generic comment "prose needs work" regardless of its literary or analytical merit, Sa'adah will keep you happy.  If, on the other hand, you are interested in taking a course that encourages you to think critically and build analytical arguments, stray as far away from her as you can - she will drive you crazy.  Her misguided grading aside, Sa'adah is ultimately ineffective as a lecturer because she drones on and on about God knows what, without focus to what she was inititally talking about or attention to the ever waning interests of her students.  Though available outside of class, she is entirely unhelpful, ultimately one of the rudest and most pretentious persons I have ever met.  Unless you are a visitor from Harvard (where she attended undergraduate and graduate school) you ultimately will remain to her an inferior product of the U.S. educational system.  Though she 'officially' states that she wants to teach you how to think and analyze arguments, ultimately your own opinions will be shunned upon unless they miraculously match her own.  Oh yes, if you DO take her, footnote EVERYTHING.  She will 'warn' you of plagiarism if even one sentence is not cited to a source, no matter how rooted it is in common sense.  To all of you who can, stay far, far away.

Professor Sa'adah is a brilliant and engaging woman who has a clear understanding of her field and its scope.  She has a great number of office hours and is always friendly and receptive during individual meetings.  She also welcomes questions in class and responds well.  Professor Sa'adah is also a demanding professor and tough grader.  She assigns many books and hundreds of pages of reading, and the class moves along very quickly.  Most students earn Cs and Bs on their first papers.  If you improve throughout the term though, she will likely only consider the grade on your final paper.  The grade she gives you for the course also tends to be higher than the grades you received on your papers.  Many people complain about her rigorous grading and harsh comments on papers.  Prof. Sa'adah takes her job seriously and gives honest criticism and guidance with the goal of improving the reading and writing skills of students.  Aside from learning a good deal about social theory and reading books by the most influential figures in the field of comparative politics, I feel like I made some significant gains in my ability to comprehend what I read and to make an effective and concise argument.  A true "Ivy League" course, I would recommend Comparative Politics with Sa'adah to anyone who does not mind reading and who is serious about government and developing analytical skills.  Note  I looked at the reading list for Becker's class, and he assigns what I would call "secondary literature" in the field of comparative politics.  Sa'adah assigns works by the great social theorists such as Marx, Weber, Tocqueville, and Huntington--individuals who attempt to explain the realities of the political world.  Although it is more demanding, the reading Sa'adah assigns is also more rewarding.

M. Anne
/course/1450
This course was very odd at times. Professor Sa'adah is a fantastic lecturer, yet rather wacky when it comes to structuring the course. There were only three paper assignments and no exams. The papers were limited in length to 500, 1000, and 1200 words each. This paltry collection of incredibly short papers constitutes the only gradable work in the course (the class was a lecture class with only a certain amount of participation).  Professor Sa'adah is _very_ demanding with these papers. You WILL be attacked for having "sloppy prose" (a term she never defines). If given more assignments perhaps I could have had time to work on improving the argumentative style she was looking for, but three papers hardly allows for this type of betterment.  You will not know where you stand in this class. This fact started to especially knaw at me as the term ended.   If Professor Sa'adah were to make some changes to the structure of the course, I would recommend it wholeheartedly. The books and topics covered are of immense value even to non-Govy majors. If changes are not made, however, I cannot say that this is the intro Govy course for _anyone_.
@
M. Anne
/course/1450
The course covers a HUGE basis of material.  There is a lot of reading, however, there are no tests. Rather, your grade rests on three papers... (and even the first one doesn't really count).  Professor Sa'adah also likes to go off on tangents.  However, to say she is a wealth of knowledge does little justice.  She is increadibly passionate about the subject as a political scientist rather than a historian.  This is a course of tools and methods of analyzing political systems around the world.  The readings are interesting though often difficult.  There is a huge amount of information between the books and the lectures that is not put to use (since there are no tests and only three papers).  Nevertheless, I would definitely recommend this course.  I do wish though that I would have known that though it is an "intro course," there are very few other freshman in the class.
@
M. Anne
/course/1450
Although the course material itself was interesting, the professor's lecture style rendered it inaccessible to comprehension (no visual aids, dry speaking voice, little use of chalkboard). A great deal of material would get presented in the lectures, but key concepts got buried underneath a mountain of details. Her grading system was also difficult to understand. I would recommend taking this course with another professor instead.
@
M. Anne
/course/1450
This course really taught me very little.  Prof. Sa'adah was not an effective professor, and her harsh grading system did not test your knowledge of the material but rather your ability to write.  Don't take this class unless you are an amazing writer.  Even if you are an amazing writer, she will probably find some way to prove that you are not.  Also, she assigned way more material than was necessary to do.

Lectures are very interesting and entertaining. Barely any discussion. Readings are somewhat dense and stat heavy. Tons of readings(30-100 pages per class), but it is somehow expected for gov department. He places his presentation into canvas after class and pretty much covers what you can expect on exams in class with minor exceptions. Horowitz tries to make his course more fun than you could expect from intro course in govt department. 1st part the transition from autocracy to democracy or why it never happens based on cases from China, USSR, Arab Spring, etc. 2nd part electoral systems comparison based on cases from Rwanda, South Africa, Yugoslavia. Final 5 pages essay. Didn't have quizzes or actual final exam. He was playing with numbers a little bit if you didn't do too good on the first midterm to improve grades, but it's only critical if you're in between grades. Strict essay/short answer grader. Seems like he's interested mostly in Africa. Couple times canceled classes after major snowstorms. Held office hours and was available outside of those.
@
Jeremy Horowitz
/course/1450
I took this class my sophomore year, so I felt well-prepared, but I think I would have only gotten the median as a freshman because the class requires careful reading and studying in preparation for short-answer exams. The exams have fair and not overly nitpicky questions, but can still be tricky because Prof. Horowitz is a somewhat strict short answer grader. The tests also require good time management - the first exam required us to complete 58 short answer questions in 60 minutes, but he shortened the test length to 50 questions in 60 minutes - which was manageable but still not easy due to the academic rigor of the tests. His curves are generous to students who perform below the median, however, and it's fairly difficult to get below a B or B- on his exams, so don't stress! There were no pop quizzes - other Gov 4 profs sometimes do have them, though - and our grade was determined by a first hour-long exam (33%), a second long-exam (33%), and a five-page final paper based on the fourth unit of the material (33%). There is about 35-40 or so pages of reading assigned for each class meeting (with some historical readings occasionally that are longer but that we can read more quickly / holistically), so make sure to allot at least 3-4 hours (or longer, if you're a slow reader like me). Prof. Horowitz goes over the readings well in class but you still need to do them in order to do well on his exams. Overall, this was a good class - for an intro Gov course or otherwise - and I would recommend it. I learned a lot because Prof. Horowitz chose the readings very carefully and they connect to one another very well! He is also a very nice prof and is extremely knowledgeable about comparative politics.

Jeremy Horowitz
/course/1450
This class had two exams and a final paper, which were each 33% of the grade. The readings varied from super interesting case studies to mundane, data-heavy, and theoretical. Professor Horowitz is clearly an expert on the subject, but his lectures are essentially recaps of the reading, so class seems redundant most of the time. The tests are quite difficult, made of entirely short answer questions. The final essay was a nice, easy way to end the course. Overall, it was a good course.

Course Awesome and interesting material. Learned a lot about what happens within countries around the world. First 4 weeks spent on democracy and why some countries have it as well as how authoritarians maintain power. Next 2 weeks comparing and contrasting USSR and China. Next 2 weeks spent on institutions of democracies, and last 2 weeks on causes of civil war. Exams 1 midterm, just memorize author's name, year, and main idea of work and pretty simple. 1 Paper comparing and contrasting China and USSR, and final exam structured like midterm (not cumulative). Also 6 pop quizzes that are pretty easy, three questions each (one of which is your name). Workload Not much, about 30 pages of reading per class. Professor Horowitz can be a bit boring as a lecturer (the material is still fascinating), but he pretty much summarizes the readings every lecture, so even if you didn't do one you'll be caught up if there isn't a quiz.

Course The lectures were absolutely impossible to pay attention to, yet everyone else seemed to be hanging on to his every word. I don't understand. Maybe because most gov majors are try hards?

Took the time to memorize everyone's names. Warning generally strict essay/short answer grader, especially if this was your first social science class at D like it was for me.

I heard worse things about some other Gov 4 classes, but Horowitz was great. We covered lots of topics thoroughly, and the case studies complemented the theory at a good pace. Super interesting.

No fishing through readings trying to figure out what the prof is looking for - he points out the best parts of each article and really teaches how to effectively read a political writing.  Really great guy overall, super nice and approachable and funny.  loved his classes.  two exams and a final plus one short take home essay before the final.  i personally thought it was the best and most organized class i have ever had.

There is a lot of material to get through in the class, but Deane does an outstanding job of keeping the class moving through it.  Her slides are sometimes a bit confusing after the lecture, so I recommend attending all of the classes.  Papers and test questions are not surprises by any stretch of the imagination - just look at the syllabus.  She can sometimes speak quickly and in long, long sentences, but ask her to repeat herself or slow down.  Fast moving class, but you can keep yourself afoat if you stay on top of things.

This course usually gets excellent reviews.  However, this course is usually taken by freshman who don't know what a good class is like.  The professor was energetic, engaging, and charismatic, and apparently first-years mistake these qualities for good teaching.  In actuality, this was a second-rate course in name-dropping.  We were given many, many names and concepts and one fact about each of them, so we could "drop them into papers and discussion in higher level classes and sound real smart." A miserable and worthless class.

I can honestly say that this was most likely the best class I've taken thus far at Dartmouth.  Prof. Deane is amazing not to mention brilliant.

The class itself was interesting, but only if you don't mind learning the names of tons of theorists and theories. Deane is somewhat unorganized and her powerpoint slides, which are available for download and upon which the entire course is based, are riddled with unintelligible abbreviations. She also seems to pick her favorites, so if you want a good grade in this class go to office hours and ask questions.

I'm still a bit bitter with this class several terms after the fact.  The class lacked any coherent theme, point, or direction and the 'group discussions' that proceded every lecture bordered on pointless at least i can't remember them ever doing anything productive.  The grading structure was fairly normal midterm, paper, and final, although Deane's grading seemed completely random.  For what I thought was the same quality work I got a B+, A-, and B respectively.  The median of a B was also unusually low for an intro gov class.  Bottom line, hurting your gpa in a good class where you learn something is one thing ... doing so for a pointless requirement borders on tragic -- take the class with someone else!

I thought the class was very well taught and structured.  Professor Deane was incredibly responsive to students both in and out of class- always available for questions and concerns.

She is simply brilliant, and I learned a great deal from her.
@

The material really only covers Europe and the U.S. so don't be fooled by the description.

The research paper is also a major part of the grade so get started early.

This review is probably no longer relevant because of Dr. Beckerâ€™s retirement, but will nonetheless provide good perspective on future GOVT 04 courses.  Dr. Becker was by far the most boring lecturer Iâ€™ve ever had on this campus.  He doesnâ€™t read from his lectures, but clearly makes no effort to make them as palatable as they possibly can become.  As a History major, Iâ€™ve found professorial outlines written on the board before class (and then scrupulously followed by the professor) as methods conducive to lectures that are both interesting and understandable.  Not once did Dr. Becker venture to write an outline, especially given the fact that at least a few of us were not GOVT majors amenable to the techno-babble-laden nature of Government courses.  His exams were awful, in the respect that they asked questions whose very nature demanded that you already have an â€œintuitive ideaâ€ over the outlines of the lectures (which he did not give) and therefore could have named â€œthe two certain of thisâ€ and the â€œfour methods/characteristicsâ€ of that.  Whatâ€™s worse, there is absolutely no choice; for both the final and midterm you are required to do all the questions.  There is no way out if youâ€™ve done anything less than 95 percent of the reading.  Only the paper was graded fairly, and in an odd sort of way, the non-majors probably did better than the majors, who probably got so enamored with their own GOVT expertise that they placed too much emphasis on advanced concepts not congenial to material on Comparative Politics, precisely when Dr. Becker only want an analysis of a countryâ€™s political institutions in the context of liberal democratic ideals based only on some very basic materials solely taught in the course and not elsewhere.  There are perhaps better ways of fulfilling the SOC distributive, although the SOC requirement itself is quite painful.  Good luck on shopping for the elusively easy SOC killer.
@
David G.
/course/1450
This class was Prof Becker's last class at Dartmouth. Perhaps he lost enthusiasm cuz the class got more boring as the term progressed. The class grade is based on a midterm, a 10 pg term paper, a final and random attendance checks. It was the type of class you couldn't skip because sometimes he'd discuss stuff that wasn't in the readings. The class was a 2A which exacerbated the sense of boredom.
@

This is overall a good course. Expect to learn a lot from a prof. who really studies this material (he works for Freedom House). The term paper can be very interesting, especially if you choose a country whose system that you want to study. Lectures are very organized, and expect to come out with lots of information. Too bad that Prof. Becker's no longer teaching, though.
@
David G.
/course/1450
...then this may be the class for you. It was a deciding factor in my choice to not switch from IR to Comparative Gov't. The class was long, and interest short. Not that the prof. was *bad*, but he wasn't there to make anyone interested in the material, that's for certain. Government classes often suffer when extended to the 2-hour slots, and this was one that should have been cut to a 1-hour. I *think* I learned something, but it disappeared quickly in that haze that you get covering your memory when you've learned something when half-asleep. Another one of my few not-really-positive reviews.
@
David G.
/course/1450
Becker is a competent teacher but nothing special.  If you do badly on the midterm (as I did) he rewards improvment on the final.  As a result I got an A.  There is also a final research paper which is fairly time consuming (12 pages), it took me many hours of work, but actually I could probably have done less cuz he wrote on it that it far exceeded expectations.  (Hint research Canada.  There are tons of books on its government, written by people who speak English and are actually from the country.  Plus it's not too different from the U.S.)

Prof. Becker really took what could have been an interesting class and made it a snooze. His lectures are almost impossible to sit through, especially for two hours. He drones on in a monotone and has a weird habit of staring at one point at the back of the room instead of looking at the students. He is, however, a pretty nice guy and an easy grader.  The class material itself was not bad. It was a little dry when we read about general systems of government (communism, totalitarianism) but it became mroe interesting as we talked about specific foreign governments.  The grades in the class come from an essay midterm and a final paper. Neither one was very difficult. I kind of enjoyed the paper as it was a way for me to learn about comparative politics without hearing Becker talk about it.  Take this class, but avoid taking it with Prof. Becker.

Dimitrov expects a lot of class participation but doesn't grade based on it, supposedly. A lot of times, the class was dead and awkward.

Dimitrov is an excellent Prof.  However, I think I did well in this class since I had taken more government courses than most.

This class is great, though, and really not that hard.
@
Martin K.
/course/1450
Not too much work, but the work there is very fairly tests how well one knows the material. Dimitrov is a very friendly, approachable guy, and obviously loves the subject.   So far the only class I've taken that encourages lively discussion, and challenges students to think critically and beyond simply reciting material from the readings and lectures.   Lecture notes are posted online and lectures are roughly follow the readings, so it's not critical to go to every class. But you should go anyway, the lectures are incredibly interesting and class is usually very enjoyable.
@
Martin K.
/course/1450
This is a great introductory course. The professor's lectures were organized and elucidating. When time permits, we had class discussions in which he encouraged students to think on their own, as political scientists in training. Dimitrov is very knowledgeable about the subject matter, and any bias he has is mitigated by the fact that he acknowledges them and welcomes diverse opinions from the students.   The readings, exams, and paper assignments were just right in that the professor aims for a level of difficulty just above that with which the students are comfortable. Don't take this class if you don't like to think.

First of all, Dimitrov is one hot professor, unfortunately that does not make a good class. Sitting through this 10A was torture, the readings dry as bone, and it was just an awkward experience being in the class- like a bad date.  The tests are fair enough, he's an easy grader, and I don't think he expects too much.  He was also 5-10 minutes late to class everyday and 20 minutes late to our final.

The grade was based on attendance, two midterms, and a short final essay comparing Russia and China; we only had one lecture on India before the second midterm, so the only real reason to go to lectures after that was for the participation aspect of the grade.    The lectures were definitely interesting.  Much of the time was spent analyzing the readings for the day and learning why Prof. Vandewalle agreed or disagreed with them, which made the lectures pretty important for a good performance on the exams and paper.  Overall, I enjoyed the class, and Prof. Vandewalle certainly seems to know just about everything there is to know about comparative politics.  The major downside was that the material sometimes got a little dry and hard to get excited about at 845 a.m.

Let me preface my comments by stating that I find comparative politics to be a rather interesting field; I had substantial knowledge in the field before I took this course from a high school class and from my own reading.  If you do not find learning about the internal politics and governmental institutions and policies (political, economic, and social) of different countries interesting or enjoyable, then this course is probably (or even clearly) not for you.  The grade for the term in this course was based on two exams during the term (one more or less mid-term and the other in the second-to-last week of term) that together composed 60% of the final grade (30% each), one final paper (20%), and class participation and attendance (20%).  Although the final grade was based on relatively few grades, I found Prof. Vandewalle's grading policies to be fair.  Professor Vandewalle is an extremely engaging, knowledgeable professor who is more than willing to discuss class material and other aspects of comparative politics, etc. at length outside of class with individual students, despite his often-busy schedule.  He plans his lectures well, in them elucidating the main points of the assigned readings and bringing in his own and other perspectives on the topics at issue.  Although Prof. Vandewalle is a highly effective lecturer, the fact that the class was a 9L this term, I think, detracted substantially from the energy in the room.  I am not a fan of the 9L time slot, but if this class is offered in the future at the 9L to be taught by Prof. Vandewalle, I would recommend it highly nonetheless.  The material in the course as taught by Prof. Vandewalle focuses first on the fundamentals of comparative politics and then on four case studies the Middle East (primarily Libya, one of Prof. Vandewalle's specialties), Russia, China, and India.  The democracy-authoritarianism dichotomy and institutionalization are major themes throughout the course.  Perspectives from political economy are often highlighted.  My main (merely minor) complaints about this course were (1) that it was taught at the 9L, not a good time for us college students generally; and (2) that the case studies did not include a Western state (i.e. France, Germany, the U.K., or even Mexico, a state that is now studied often in the field of comparative politics).  That said, I found the course to be highly rewarding and the readings to be highly relevant.

Spanish 3 was a pretty easy class. No new grammar is learned, and the first couple of weeks are spent revising ser/estar from spanish 1. The class is pretty slowly paced, and not particularly challenging. Professor Runnels is nice, and a fair marker, but sometimes does not explain things clearly. Overall, if you want an easy course to take, spanish 3 is perfect!
@

/course/2835
If you're not going on the LSA/FSP (whichever one gives the Spanish 3 credit) then consider taking Spanish 3 with Professor Runnels. I took Spanish 1,2,3 here and Spanish 3 is like the culminating experience where you basically review Spanish 1 and 2.  Here are the tenses we learned present,preterit,imperfect,future,conditional,subjunctive, past/perfect tenses, pluscaumperfect, and maybe I'm missing one but if you are familiar with these then skip Spanish 1-2 and go right into 3. I feel like all the Prof. follow the same material and have the same stuff to teach each term, so it's pretty generalized  Overall Runnels is a good guy, he really doesn't have to "teach" much since most of the material is going to be the same between the diff. Spanish 3 classes. If you have questions he is very responsive and understanding and will take time to make sure you understand.  If you take it in the Spring, class will be outside sometimes!

"I'm not teaching you how to speak Spanish, I'm teaching you how to pass Spanish 3" is a quote from Professor Runnels. Although his point was that you need to go to a spanish speaking country to really learn spanish, he seemed to not make much of an effort to improve our spanish conversing abilities. If I hadn't taken a lot of spanish in HS I imagine I would have been in a bit of trouble with this class grade-wise. Basically, you probably need to take this class, but try to get it with a differet prof if you can. I think Prof Asensio is better, and Prof Armstrong may or may not be better.
@

/course/2835
You don't learn any new grammer.  Its just a review of what you already know.  You do read and write a lot of spanish which builds vocab., but the stories are really weird and take a while to work through.    Professor Runnels was very disorganized.  I really don't have a good idea of what my grade will be in the course, because we rarely get grades back besides test grades.  It seems like Runnels is just along for the ride.
@

/course/2835
Not an interesting class. Prof Runnels however is an interesting guy.  He will digress and talk about the time a coyote saved him in a white out in fargo or about sailing down south america (all in english).  But he doesn't teach very effectivly.  He gets things confused often and a 65 minute class seems VERY long.  If you really want to immerse yourself in spanish this is not the prof for you, go on the LSA.  If you want to have to speak minimal spanish and just get your language credits, its alright.

even though the class was at 9, I enjoyed going to class.  I thought the prof made the class fun.  we didnt always do anything productive in class though.  still, if you took Spanish 2 at the school, this class will be a breeze.
@
Dennis M.
/course/2835
Runnels is an absolute joke.  The fact that he is hired to teach a spanish course indicates precisely how little the school has invested in its foreign languages.  The tests are not intrinsically that hard.  Yet, Runnels' complete inability to convey information in an intelligible manner MAKES them hard.  I would also speculate that the other professor who taught this term--not runnels--wrote the exams.    if you want to learn spanish, and I would suggest that is a reasonable goal, do yourself a favor and take anyone BUT runnels.

this class was basically a repeat of spanish 2 with more writing involved and no drill.  You might think that's awesome, but drill is actually helpful.  Don't get this class at 9am.    Runnels was all right, a bit hard to understand at times, but a nice guy.

Professor Runnels is really great.  He's really responsive to students, he's totally willing to talk to you- I really think he's a great professor.  I like Spanish, but the classes got a little boring just going over grammar.  That's what a Spanish class is, though- so it's not his fault.  He tried, and he's awesome at what he does.  Overall I was very pleased with this class, and I recommend it.

Sr. Runnels is a good prof but his teaching style takes a little getting used to. He grades a little hard on tests sometimes. Advice Study the material out of the book and make sure to come to class the day before the test for the review and make sure to read and understand the stories assigned  )

Class was engaging and we covered enough to really feel like we learned all the material. The only downside was that the class was assigned to Gerry, that monstrosity from the sixties with bare brick interior walls, tile floors, cramped desks and all the plumbing hanging out. Because of this, the classroom was not at all pleasing, but the class itself was.
@

/course/2835
In Spanish 3, Prof. Runnels reviewed a lot of grammer that was covered in Spanish 2, but he also incorporated more stories and poetry into the class.  It was great to be able to actually read things from other cultures.  Maybe you're the type of person who just likes languages for the sake of languages, but I see them more as windows and doors rather than things that are interesting in their own right.  I don't have to take anymore courses in Spanish, but I think I will anyway.  Things are just starting to get interesting.

This course provides a thorough review of pretty much everything learned in the first few levels of Spanish during high school. If you have taken a fair amount (more than 2 years)of Spanish before, chances are, this course will not challenge you as it will be review of grammar and you probably will have read most of the stories in high school. There is not much of an emphasis on speaking; the focus is more grammar based.

This class was okay.  It was not particularly fun.  Organized lectures could have helped me learn the concepts better than worksheets and group discussion.  I guess it is what you make out of it.  You will advance in your Spanish if you choose to and you will not if you do not put in the extra time and work with others who do when you have discussion time in class.

Spanish 3 is basically a review of everything done in 1 and 2, plus reading some short stories. It was a good review for me, having not taken spanish in high school, but even then it was fairly boring and slow.  The readings are all short stories, and most are fairly interesting.
@
Dennis M.
/course/2835
Spanish 3 seems to be a review of the first 2 courses; if you placed out of 1 and 2, don't expect to have any problems here.  We reviewed basic grammer all the way through the latest tenses and read some great literature along the way.  Watching telenovelas was awesome!  Professor Runnels is dedicated to having students learn the material--he spoke a lot of English to make sure we were understanding everything.  He also integrated his extensive cultural knowledge and life experience into his explanations of the themes presented in the readings; thus, we learned a lot more than just the language!  He can ramble sometimes but he had us laughing at many points during the term.  One downside--I don't believe I internalized the material because there wasn't much new stuff (if any) presented.  A fun class, but if you want to improve a lot on Spanish, especially in conversation, this course (or prof) might not be the best place to do it...Nevertheless, time well spent.

Profesora Guzman-Bueno is a fantastic lady. She's funny, sweet and bubbly all the time. I don't think I ever saw her without a smile on her face. You can tell she is the kind of professor who cherishes all of her students and wanted to help each and every one of us to do our best.   The class was a good mix of grammar, listening, speaking, reading and writing. We watched episodes of a Spanish telenovela and read several culturally significant stories. Through these, we didn't just practice our skills with the language, but we also learned about Spanish culture in the 60's and 70's, which I thought was very interesting.   Overall, this was a great class. Take any class with Prof. Guzman-Bueno!

Gladys is a great professor with a ton of energy, even in the 9 slot.  She is so little and animated, which helps us learn the material (mostly the animated part).   I was a bit worried about going right into Spanish 3 as I hadn't taken spanish really since 10th grade of high school.  However, I was able to learn the grammar from the reader.  The class was a small amount of regular homework, which is very doable.  But the readings took some time because they included a  lot of Spanish we didn't know and required the use of a dictionary and they were sometimes as long as 15 pages.  Everything you do in the class is designed to be easy to get about a 90 on.  Therfore it is frustrating when it is almost impossible to attain an A, which is set at a 95 or above, but it seems all the undeserving students get A-'s as well.  All in all it was a good class that I feel improved my Spanish greatly.

I took this to get my language requirement fullfilled, so I wasn't as passionate about taking Spanish 3 as I was about the other classes I took. The material is basically a review of Spanish 2 or anything you learn in high school, so thats not hard, but there are short stories that you have to read that can be a pain to understand. Thankfully you go over them in class enough so you can get what's going on. Guzman-Bueno made this class - If you can, TAKE SPANISH WITH GUZMAN-BUENO. She's the sweetest person in the world, and she's relatively easy. As long as you do the HW and study for the tests (only 2), you're probably guarenteed at least a B+. The other prof. takes the class much more seriously; Guzman-Bueno is sometimes border-line crazy with the stuff she says and she's an easy grader.

Spanish 3 is basically a giant waste of time if you've taken 1 and 2 on campus, because it's essentially a review of the grammar you did in 2. If you're planning on taking Spanish 9, this course prepares you with preliminary literary analysis skills, but other than that, you should be able to coast through this class very easily.   Profesora Guzman absolutely makes the class. She's funny, sweet, and really cares about the students. Without her, this class would have been painful, but she really made it enjoyable to be there.

Prof Polli tried convincing me to take more Spanish courses after Spanish 3, but completely honestly, I would only take them if she taught them.  She is wonderful.  She's exciting in class and always had us do interesting activities.  She really emphasizes speaking and incorporates speaking activities into every class.  The exams and class overall isn't very difficult, but there's a lot of little homework assignments that you have to remember to do.  Spanish 3 specifically has a lot of papers too, which was somewhat annoying, but she's not too picky about length (even if she specifies it).  There are many readings too, and some of them are pretty difficult, but she goes over them in detail in class so there's nothing to worry about.  If you need to take any Spanish class, and she's teaching a section, DEFINITELY take it with Prof Polli!!

Lively, passionate (about the language that is), hardworking, she inspires hard work in her students - certainly seeing how much she invested in our class made me want to work hard. She was constantly assessing where we were at as a class and adopting/ developing new exercizes accordingly.  I never dreaded going to her class because she always kept it invigorating. Never a dull moment. We were always talking, thinking, moving around, etc....  Sooo glad I had this class with Polli.

Professor Matorras is really sweet.  She came in with a good sense of humor to class each day.  She usually gives a lesson on the blackboard of grammar (a review of pretty much all the grammar in Spanish 2).  Tests were fair, but you needed to prepare well for them.  More focus on the cuentos than on the vocab, as in Spanish 2.

The title of this review sums up how I felt in class every single day.  Rosa's lectures are either way too fast and gloss over the topic at hand or way too slow and seem to cater to an elementary school group.  There was a TON of busy work given in class and really annoying/pointless oral exercises that wasted time that could have been better spent.  Her tests were really confusing and it was often unclear what she was asking for.  She was only available for office hours one time per week.  Also, we were never let out of class on time...NEVER.

with the language requirment.  Spanish 3 is just a review of Spanish 2, except it is graded harder.  Matorras seemed pretty hard at first, but she turned out to not be.

It seemed to me that we went over the same grammar as in spanish 2, but mistakes on tests and compositions were worth more because grading was stricter.

I liked the pace of the class. Each week consisted of grammar hw, which doesn't take long and isn't hard, and either a synopsis of a story/movie (~7 total), in class composition (we were supposed to do 2, but we ended up doing one in class and one as hw), or test (2 midterms). There's a lot of writing (synopses and tests) but it's pretty basic stuff.   Professor Matorras was nice and helpful and patient. She makes good use of class time.

this class was a good way to close out the language requirement. some of the grammar towards the end started to get tough but other than that it was pretty easy. prof. matorras is very friendly and helpful...I think the class would have been more fun if she could have decided the curriculum instead of the department. we had to read a bunch of short stories and summarize them and analyze themes and stuff...it got annoying after a while. it was a class I didn't mind going to, though, which says something considering it was a 9L. and it's amazing how much you learn in the spanish program here, I feel like I could actually have a conversation with someone if I needed to. I guess that's the point.
@

Though a lot of the time the grammar homework was boring, it was supplemented by interesting short stories and a great film.  Professor Matorras is great, but a little disorganized--don't be afraid to ask her questions and make sure you know what you're supposed to do on specific projects.  An oral poetry recitation was mandatory (and the instructions were a bit confusing) but I found that practicing for it really helped with pronunciation.  Talk as much as you can in class.  Some people aren't really into the class because they're just getting rid of the language requirement, but try not to be one of those people because you can get a lot out of the course.

Spanish 3 is a little rough, but Rosa understands and tries to work with her students...honestly, her overall attitude made me stay in the class and I'll never regret taking it with her.  Rosa clarifies the material very well with helpful study sheets, and is always at office hours (barely attended by students). She also attends and teaches at every class, and will stop to make sure everyone understands!  Amazingly, she was embarrazada al tiempo--but still was available for appointments, a link to additional resources, helped me arrange for a tutor, etc....that shows you just how truly dedicated she was to the effective teaching of her students!!

Spanish 3 was bad because of Rosa. The class was fun at times when we had small group discussions, and at the beginning of class we always talked about how our week was going. the class was split between overly eager 11's and upperclassmen who didn't care and were just trying to finish their distrib. She's a rough grader on the weekly paragraphs that discuss a reading. Rosa was sort of nice, but she didn't explain any of the grammar, and i don't know how she picked our grades on papers. theres also a poem recitation, 2 tests, and 2 pop quizzes in the first week or two.   Spanish 3 can be better if you have a different prof. It's not very hard, just don't take it with Rosa. I highly recommend guzman-bueno if possible, i had her for span2 and she's awesome

This course covers the same grammar material from Span 2, just in more detail.  The hardest part is reading the literature and understanding it.  I often spent hours translating just one story.  A 150 word synopsis on each story is required, about one every week, which can be challenging but are doable.  Tests and compositions are more difficult b/c they require analysis of the literature, which is hard even in English.  Overall, not an impossible course, oftentimes boring, tho the readings are interesting even if time-consuming.  Prof. Armstrong is a nice guy but not the best prof.  We seldom seemed to actually learn things in class, tho we did try to talk about the stories.  Armstrong does try to get to know the students individually tho, including our writing styles and ways of thinking, which I give him points for.  He is certainly an interesting person and a nice enough guy.

I've never taken Spanish at Dartmouth before, so I didn't really know what to respect. I took AP Lang in high school but didn't get out of the Dartmouth language requirement. I found this class to be pretty easy and a little boring.

Armstrong doesn't seem to know how to teach.  His lectures are disorganized, and his accent makes it very hard to understand his Spanish.  His grading is anal and doesn't seem to make sense, and he'll tell you he wants you to only write a certain amount, then penalize you for following those restrictions.  Write more if you can.  He can also be very patronizing, and likes to subtly criticize people both during class and in private.  Wait and take Spanish 3 with another prof if you can.

Armstrong is a great guy, fun and really nice. However, Spanish 3 is really boring in the way it is structured. The stories are all good and fun to read, but take a long time so be prepared to spend a while on them. The grammar exercises were absolutely awful, waste of time. I truly feel like I didn't learn a whole lot more spanish than I knew in Sp. 2. But, still, if you can, take Sp 3 with this prof.

I'm SO SO SO SO SO happy I took Spanish 3 with Armstrong. He was fantastic. He made the course material so straightforward and applicable. I thought he made great sense of confusing grammar problems, etc. He's funny and interesting, entertaining and intelligent.  Great class!!!

Portuguese intro classes are a pretty big time commitment, because Port 1 and 3 both have extra classes every week in addition to class and drill every day.  Still, it's definitely worth it because the language is so unique and Prof. Armstrong teaches it very well, even though the class is fast-paced, as it needs to be since it is essentially 3 classes in only 2 terms.  Prof. Armstrong is very helpful and responsive when students have questions in class.  He also divides the time well between grammar, culture (we listened to a lot of Brazilian music in class, which was great), and general interactive exercises to make sure we all were getting a chance to practice speaking.  All in all, a very well run class, if you're willing to make the time commitment.

work work work. fatigue is a major factor since nearly everyone did the class last term as well. it's hard to stay into it when there is so much work and class time that you need to attend.  Professor Armstrong clearly cares about his students and he's always willing to help. he expects a lot though.   I am glad I took the class. I learned a lot and you form some really awesome friendships with your classmates.

This class is 13 hours a week. It consumes MOST of your time. There is homework everyday, sometimes too much, and it can be a bit overbearing at times. Some of it is interesting but it definately is a stress if you dont keep up with the work or understand the material. Professor Armstrong is EXTREMELY prepared for class, but has a hard time explaining things to you when you dont understand. He makes you feel stupid if you still dont get the material. Spanish is such a great language....
@
Piers Armstrong
/course/2835
Professor Armstrong listened to some of our comments from last term, and this term he tried to answer more of our questions in class and tried to present material more clearly, but in most ways, he still is a bad prof....I think he is probably an excellent scholar but just has trouble communicating with students and cannot make learning exciting because he is intrinsically a cold person....unless by some miracle he improves siginificantly, i still would not take this course unless you really, really want to...

I did not take Spanish 1 or 2 at Dartmouth and I was a little bit worried about taking Spanish 3; I thought I was going to be way underprepared. This class ended up being a lot easier than I expected though. The tests only focus on grammar and they are incredibly simple. There is a lot of busy work (on-line workbook exercises, watching/writing a synopsis of Cuentame, etc) but still less work than your average Dartmouth class. Drill is a pain but it's only 3x/week.   Sprague is very nice and clearly wants everyone to do well. She's an easy grader for the most part (although grading on the oral presentation and oral exam seemed a little arbitrary). She does assign random things due next class fairly often--they only take 20 - 30 minutes, but they're annoying.
@
Paula A.
/course/2835
She's a good teacher, responsive and likes to talk with students. However, be prepared for assignment out of the blue and to not follow the syllabus all that closely. Overall, I don't think this course was bad, but you gotta take it if you have to finish your requirement.

After completing the IB Spanish program in high school, this course was a great segway into the upper level spanish courses, and definitely sparked my interest in the department. Great overview of grammar and vocabulary, and great practice in reading, writing, and speaking spanish.

/course/2835
Prof. Sprague did a good job teaching this course, but the nature of Spanish 3 is pretty irritating. There is a lot of pointless required homework that takes up a lot of time, doesn't help you learn the material, and doesn't give you many points in the class. Sprague did a good job explaining the grammar and outlining the stories we had to read. She graded exams and homework fairly.
@
Paula A.
/course/2835
Basically I just took this class to get my language requirement, and the class was fine for that.  It's not very interesting material (the readings were mostly pretty boring) and Prof. Sprague's not that interesting either.  But Prof. Sprague is really understanding and totally willing to give you the benefit of the doubt.  Basically it's an easy A, though you'll probably be bored.
@

/course/2835
Professor Sprague is an absolutely wonderful lady; she relates well to her students and inspires an excitement for the subject, while maintaining a laid-back approach.  Having taken four years of Spanish in high school, this class was mostly review, but it was useful nevertheless.  However, since I'm planning on minoring, I do wish I had taken the placement test to begin in Spanish 9 (which, luckily, Professor Sprague also teaches).

Paloma Asensio
/course/2835
Spanish 2 had 8 weekly assignments with ~80 questions each.  Each assignment took me seven hours to do (I got a high grade on them).  The class had two midterms and a final which were straightforward and graded objectively.  I simply memorized the tenses and vocab on the textbook pages listed in the syllabus and did very well.  There was also two essays and a speaking final, which were much less straightforward to prepare for.  I didn’t study for the essays and didn’t do great on them.  I also didn’t use Spanish spell check in word on the first essay - that was a big mistake, make sure you use it!  I spent 8 hours memorizing all 5 situations on the speaking final and did well.  Overall the class seemed to have more work than was needed to cover its rather simple vocab, tenses and language constructs - about 10 hours a week outside of drill and lecture, which granted is still a lot less than a hard Dartmouth course like ECON 26 or COSC 50.  Besides the essays and speaking final, the class felt like a high school Spanish class.  Professor Paloma was helpful and enthusiastic in class. All the assignments and exams and drills were made by the department, so no matter what professor you have your experience will likely be similar.

Great class. I learned a lot, especially through the homework. The homework helped me a lot in class, and it was easy and enjoyable. Professor Asensio is a fair grader and never played favorites with the people who were obviously much better speakers. Class was mostly all discussion exercises with the person next to you, so I made a few good friends. I enjoyed the balance it created in my schedule with reading/writing-based classes.

The course was a review of most of the material taught in Spanish 2.  The added stories were interesting and boring at the same time.  Professor Asensio was relatively nice about the class, and wasn't too hard on us.  I'm pretty sure her Spanish class had the highest median of the three taught during the term.  Id take it with her if Spanish doesn't come naturally to u.
@
Paloma Asensio
/course/2835
In a class such as Spanish III, based mostly in grammar and structure, it will either be good or bad depending on the Professor. Professor Asensio does an excellent job at teaching the material at a fast past, but not so fast that you get lost. The work can be a little bit repetitive, and you may resent having to do it, but in retrospect it really helped to learn the material. Of course there is more CuÃ©ntame, work from the grammar book, short essays, short stories, but believe me, it could be way, way worse. For a class that will finish out the language requirement, this is one worth taking. Additionally, Professor Asensio is very approachable and wants you to do well in her class. If you have any problems at all, be it with grades or understanding the subject matter, she will help you. Considering you have to do a language at some point, and if you pick Spanish, take Asensio's class to finish out the requirement.

Easy A. Paloma Asensio really cared about the students and wanted to get to know them. She was very understanding.  Homework was rather easy and we watched an episode of a spanish soap opera a week and wrote a very short essay on them. They were quite fun and we would always discuss them in class before we wrote the essays so they were really easy and easy to get high A's on.

Books "Repaso", is the worst review of Spanish grammar that I have ever seen. It is badly organized, confusing, and utterly ridiculous. I was forced to go back to my books from high school in order to clarify basic points.   The short stories were okay. Mildly interesting. Overall, not too terrible.   Tests The tests were structured poorly, and the directions were not incredibly clear. It's really depressing if you mess up one section, because then the entire grade seems to balloon down sharply. There were also purposely tricky questions, that required you remember minor grammar exceptions.    Prof I have to give her some credit. The books and tests were not so much a reflection of her teaching, as they were a reflection of the coursework for Spanish 3 in general. However, the grading did appear a bit arbitrary at times. It may be because it was her first term. Overall, though, she is very nice, and is always available if you need help after class. She tried her best to make the material interesting, which I appreciated.   Basically, with this class, I felt that the effort I put in did not correlate with the grades I received. I sincerely hope you guys don't have the same experience.

Spanish 3 on the Barcelona LSA is 2 classes ConversaciÃ³n with Miriea or Juan and GramÃ¡tica with Eva.  Convo class is awesome, possibly the best class ever.  You just sit in a circle and talk about whatever you want, because the point of the class is to get you to talk (so do it!).  Grammar is standard, just like any other foreign language grammar class.  Heads up though, Eva is kind of a bitch.  Double heads up, her tests are exact photo copies of exercises from the book, most of which we had already done for homework.

/course/2835
This is a review for the conversaciÃ³n and gramÃ¡tica classes.  The scores for the review are for Eva Martinez (gramÃ¡tica).  She was a great prof that really cared about the students, but the order of the course could have been better, we thought.  Some concepts were way too easy for our level, while others were way over our heads.  But she was a nice and energetic professor.  Joan was my conversaciÃ³n prof and *everyone* in my class loved him!  He was nice, interested in us, and made talking easy.  I loved the course.  The other group on our LSA, who took Mirea EspaÃ±ol's class strongly disliked it, while for our group this was our favorite class.

/course/2835
I had to take this class to finish language requirements but I absolutely loved it because Aguado is such an amazing prof. Unlike Span. 1 and 2, we didn't focus entirely on grammer but acutally did a lot of ficional reading and watched some good films. Aguado really emphasized speaking the language so he would ask interesing questions during the class to spark discussion. He's a fair grader so the papers were not too hard and the exams weren't bad either. He's really enthusiastic in class and also during office hours. I liked the class a lot, mostly because he's such a great prof., the best I've had from the Span. department so far.

I took this class to get rid of the remainder of my language requirement, as I'm not a huge fan of languages.  However, I thought the professor did a good job both teaching and pacing the material to meet the needs of the class.  Readings ran the gambit from pretty easy to fairly difficult, and were interesting, if at times a little strange.  Overall, a decent class made better by a good professor.
@
Joseph Aguado
/course/2835
This course was fun and interesting on the whole.  Some care was required doing the readings, but they were interesting.  The true beauty of this course is that Aguado is a really easygoing grader and that the workload is quite manageable it's many minor assignments as opposed to a few big ones, and it does wonders for your written Spanish, although it isn't as helpful for the oral.  The grammar gets boring and tedious, and you sometimes weary of the prof belaboring the same points constantly, but on the whole a good course.

spanish 3 is essentially and overview of everything you've already learned.  you spend a lot of time working on reading comprehension and the assigned stories can be pretty interesting.  class discussions are enjoyable; it's interesting to listen to people's opinions in another language.  the grammar assignments are boring and the book isn't that great...no pictures 0(    professor garcia-pena is great. this was her first term teaching at dartmouth and i was impressed by how well she handled the adjustment.  we had a pretty bright group of students, but she didn't let us settle; i really felt challenged in this class (versus spanish 2, which was cake).  i also feel like she really wanted to get to know us.

Marsha Swislocki
/course/2835
Spanish 3 with Swislocki was a big step up in the amount of work and difficulty of the work from Spanish 2 at Dartmouth. (I took Spanish 1 and 2 at Dartmouth).  The work included weekly viewing of Spanish soap opera, grammar exercises from two different books, periodic 1 page papers, readings of short stories, and culminating with the reading a spanish novel.  Swislocki loves worksheets and piles them on! Granted, the worksheets were often helpful and guided understanding of the material, but she expects that you answer all the questions, etc. before you come to class -- so what this amounts to is a lot of work to keep up in this class.  Definitely not a slow-paced, relaxing feel of spanish 1 or 2. This was a tough course. But I learned the language fairly well --- and there is NO drill!
@
Marsha Swislocki
/course/2835
I was pretty satisfied with this course. Professor Swislocki is a great prof for Spanish. She makes class interesting, and forces you to learn Spanish well. I was surprised at my own progress after having taken the class.  Readings were interesting, and at times fun. You can probably still do well if you miss the lectures but do the homework, but 1) attendance and class participation bear a significant weight on your final grade, and 2) you miss out on fun, informative lectures as well as the chance to practice what you've learned. Consider yourself very lucky if you get Professor Swislocki for Spanish III.

Ah, Rosa. I took SPAN2 with her as well, so I am all Rosa'd out. She isn't the easiest grader, and she puts documents on canvas but does not put any grades on there, so good luck knowing your grade. For some reason she is obsessed with "las fraternidades", and every Monday when she asks how our weekends were she asks if anyone went out. She also loves Enrique Iglesias and every Friday we listened to Subeme la Radio. Could be worse, but definitely could be better. This class is basically subjunctive tense on steroids, and she does a decent job of explaining everything. For the online homework, she assigns the least amount of questions of any other prof that I've seen, so at least there's that.
@

/course/2835
Not a terrible class, but not easy either.  Prof doesn't use canvas AT ALL, so if you ever miss class or forgot the homework, you're in for some trouble.  Grading isn't particularly great either, as she takes a long time to get things back to you.  As a teacher, she's pretty good.  Relatively interesting class exercises and is a fair teacher.  Not the greatest luck of the draw for a Spanish III teacher, but things could be much worse.

I was always pretty good in Spanish, but this class was just.. weird. I would study and go into tests feeling very prepared but each time they confused me like no other. The short stories we read are discussed in class, but the professor almost always got irritated with us because we didn't EXACTLY UNDERSTAND the story. To me, he was very intimidating, and he picked on students all the time. He also puts people on the spot all the time. We read short stories for homework every other class day and they took me forever because I would have to look up every other word. On the other hand, my Spanish DID improve because of this course.

The Professor was never available outside of class, and did not convey the material in an effective manner.

I did not enjoy this class, but unfortunately had to take it for a requirement.

This class was a part of the Spanish LSA in Puebla Mexico, and the spanish 3 credit was satisfied through 2 classes, speaking and grammar.

Spanish 3 was a piece of cake.  I didn't really learn anything new that I didn't know in Spanish 1 & 2.

This was a much more challenging course than I had anticipated. I took it my freshman fall, and I was in over my head. It's certainly not a course for the faint of heart in biology, even though the course description describes it as a course for non-biology majors. Due to high stress and the fact that I was studying at least 30 hours per week for this one course and still barely passing, I made the decision to drop Human Biology about half-way through the term. It was a difficult decision, but I think that I made the right choice given the circumstances. I wish that I had taken this course later on in my Dartmouth career, because I think that I would have enjoyed it more. The material was not impossible (mostly memorization), but the exams are extremely difficult and detailed. Prof. Witters was a nice man, and the TA's are nice as well, but I was in over my head at the time. The amount of incoming freshmen in the course who have previously taken AP Biology and the amount of upperclassmen in the course who are solely taking the course in preparation for the Anatomy / Physiology portion of the MCAT skew the medians on the exams, and it is difficult for students who don't have a previous Biology background. That being said, many students also like or really like the course, and numerous freshman excel in it, but please think carefully before taking it your freshman fall if you don't have a particularly strong biology background (I did not).
@
Lee Witters
/course/354
Much more challenging than anticipated. Prof Witters is great and makes himself very available to students. He also gives many helpful resources (optional X-hour reviews, weekly practice tests, online chat group, Piazza, echo 360 records lectures, even puts up his own notes on lectures, and quick review slides). This course is all about how much work you put into it... Your overall grade is based on 4 equally weighted tests and a few "extra credit" points from weekly practice tests. Keep up with the course (especially quick review slides), and you will do fine. I managed to only really do work a few days before each test and ended up with a B+ (median grade), although I wish I put in more time for this class. If you aren't very interested in bio, this isn't the class for you--its basically a traditional "weed-out" intro class that is challenging and not greatly interesting.

This was a great class! Witters is a great prof! My bio background was okay before this but now it's super strong. Sometimes it is a lot of information but he tells you what to focus on. You definitely can't study for this class the day before the midterm but give yourself 3 days and you will be good. Make sure to use office hours(7 days a week which is extremely rare for other profs), his online question system and TA study sessions. I would also print out the powerpoint slides (he will post them on canvas) and take notes on those. He is also very organized and makes lectures very interesting and fun. Don't feel like this class is "below" Bio 11. I feel extremely confident to go into a higher level biology class and this class was very fun and interesting. This class made me like bio more. Also Witters takes 5 kids out for lunch at the Pine (he pays lol) and it's great! You should do it! This is a great freshman fall class!

Lot of information, and the class moves very quickly. The class isn't hard if you have prior biology experience (especially AP bio), but if you do not have that background, make sure you have time in your schedule to dedicate to this class because it can be tough.

Dr. Witters is far and away the most accessible professor I’ve had at Dartmouth. This man gives office hours EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. and he records every lecture. He’s an engaging lecturer and really cares about his students. If you need a science distrib, take this class! It’s a bit like AP bio but completely focused on the human body, so if you find real-world information satisfying, this is the class for you!

Great class. Professor Witters is amazing. He offers office hours seven days a week and takes 5 students each week for lunch at the Hanover Inn to discuss biology topics and get some good food. He really is invested in learning and making sure everyone succeeds in his class. The workload isn't crazy either. I would not call it a layup, but as long as you go to lecture and take some notes you will be more than fine. It also is a very interesting class and Prof. Witters makes lectures really engaging . Definitely recommended for bio majors and non-majors. If you think human bio is cool, need a distrib. or are a bio major, you will enjoy this class.

Great class! Took it my freshman fall and loved it - really easy science credit for non-bio majors who are still interested in bio. All you have to do is attend the lectures, take notes, and do the practice tests; you just need to memorize all the information, so if you're good at that, you'll be good at this class. It probably helps to have an interest in bio, because there are a lot of details to memorize. Overall an amazing class, and I'm so glad I took it freshman fall!

Now this is a fantastic course. Prof. Witters is AMAZING, AMAZING. So organized, so helpful—the man held office hours 7 days a week. I mean who the heck does that? That said, it's a challenging course for non-majors, but I think well worth it as it's focus is human biology. There are a lot of pre-meds taking the course as review. I took it my freshman fall with zero biology background and definitely had to stay on top of it, but zero regrets. Recommend 10/10

I really enjoyed this class. The material is interesting and Witters always tried to include the human aspect of the science we covered (makes sense since it's a human bio course). He uses the x hour every week, either for Q&A or a video. The videos were interesting and usually helped reinforce the material, but by the end of the term almost no one was coming.  Witters is ALWAYS available. He is lightning fast responding on the Blackboard discussion board (which a ton of people use for questions) and he takes students to lunch every week. His office hours are extensive too and he podcasts all of his lectures.  This class is wonderful but expect to study a ton. The course covers a buttload of material. The class also ends up being a weird mix of people - bio majors, premed upperclassmen reviewing for the MCATs, and freshmen who want to take a bio intro course. The annoying part if you're taking it as an intro class is that it's not a prereq for any other bio courses, so you'll still have to take bio 11 to take any future bio classes.  Long story short I liked this class a lot but if you take it expect to spend a lot of time memorizing.

Lee Witters is one of the most amazing professors I've ever had at Dartmouth. His lectures are incredibly dynamic and engaging. He truly cares about his students - which is evident from all the help he offers to help you do well (office hours several times a week, practice materials and podcasts on blackboard, setting up TA office hours and review sessions). If you take advantage of all these resources and take the time to study the material, you will do well.   That said, this class is not "easy" in the sense that you can get away with spending little time outside of class studying. A lot of review IS necessary (since exams test pretty specific details from lectures) and there IS a lot of material. However, all the topics were incredibly interesting and Prof. Witters did an amazing job synthesizing everything - he weaves history, music, art, and modern applications of science into every lecture.   I would recommend this class to everyone - it's a great way to find out what study methods work best for you and the content it covers is relevant and meaningful. You won't forget this course.

This was a good class, but it was only good for the students who excel in biology. For those who either struggle or get behind quickly, the class is much too fast-paced and Witters does not take the time to bring you up to speed. In fact, I was shocked by his rudeness on more than one occasion.   However, if you do well, he will treat you well. Stay on his good side and you will be rewarded.

Prof. Witters rocks. He's awesome. Easy easy class. Totally reasonable tests. Just take it!  Ok, so if you want more detail...  Witters gives interesting, highly effective lectures. He makes the topic fascinating, and he shows incredible enthusiasm for the material. He knows his stuff. He's a physician himself.  I just re-watched the lectures and took notes. That got me an A. Pretty reasonable, I think. The tests were way easier than I expected, every time.  The TA's are incredible, considering how much work and time and effort they put in to help all the students.  Just take it.

Professor Witters is an amazing professor. I took this class to guage my interest in the sciences before I delved deeper into pre-med requirements but I wish I had waited until later (once I had learned how to study properly for a college course) to take this course.  Professor Witters really cares about his students. He offers extensive office hours, sets up TA review sessions/office hours several times a week (and even more around exam time), provides podcasts, powerpoints, lecture notes, a class blog and discussion board-- take advantage of ALL of these resources. That said, the lectures cover a ton of material and the exams are fairly difficult (perfect for the detail oriented).  I wasn't sure I wanted to do pre-med before taking Witters' course and for a while I was convinced I never wanted to take another science class again, but his passion for the human condition and his ability to connect biology to history, music, global health, and music of all things has sparked an interest in me that I can't ignore.  Take this class and I promise you won't forget it--just know what you are getting into if you take it freshman fall. You may not be able to appreciate its greatness so early on in ur college career and then you lose out on taking it when it really counts )

Professor Witters is an amazing teacher, and gives great lectures. I even have some of his podcasts saved on my computer for future viewing just because so much of what he teaches is useful for your daily life. The class explains everything that goes on in the body, and everything that can affect it. It's a lot of information, but all of it's essential.  That said, it's important to not slack off in the class. He technically doesn't give out homework, but he does recommend that people review the material after class, and it's very important to do so. The tests are actually hard, and if you've been lazy, you will do badly on them. Also, since the tests are the only grade, one bombed test can equal a bombed grade, with little to no chance of recovery. That shouldn't scare you away, though.I'd recommend anyone to take it, major or not. He even curves for those that aren't science majors!
@
Lee Witters
/course/354
Professor Witters will blow you away every day that you sit in on his lecture.  He integrates cartoons, animations, anecdotes, art, music, movies, and all other sorts of diversifying media to his lectures.  He always posts the power point slides that accompany his lectures on Blackboard beforehand and podcasts of the lectures afterward, which both prove to be almost as useful in review as the review slides that he compiles prior to each exam.  There aren't very many grades (three midterms and the final in addition to class participation), but Prof. Witters holds office hours nearly every day of the week on a walk-in basis for anyone with questions and his TAs hold office hours several times each week for lengthier review sessions.  One-on-one, Prof. Witters is highly personable and concerned about the performance of each student.  His passion for the subject is contagious!  If you're considering a pre-med track, looking to fulfill a distributive, or just looking for an interesting class, I highly recommend this one.  If I could give it an A+, I would.

As a biochem major I didn't need to take this course and the material was probably easier for me than for others in the class. (Don't worry, majors don't count towards the curve.) Prof. Witters made the material so interesting and so applicable that I think this is a wonderful course, especially for bio majors/pre-meds.  In no other course at Dartmouth has the medicinal side been so prevalent in a course as well as the public health prospective. If you're looking for a course that really ties all of human biology together, this is the one for you.

This class was GREAT and was made that much better by Prof Witters. This dude is incredible and definitely makes it so anyone can succeed and do well in the class because he wants you to do well. He has mad office hours and is always available by blitz to answer questions and even through BB discussion board. You don't have to buy a book (save money), he gives you all the readings printed out. The class isn't conceptually difficult but be prepared to put in a lot of time studying because there is a lot of material to go over and memorize, especially for the final. But overall I will definitely recommend this class to ANYONE. Prof Witters even takes 9 student to lunch at the Hanover Inn every Thursday.   Summary - Just take the class Really do it Do it do it do it

There are maybe three classes that have truly changed me at Dartmouth, and this is one of them.  I started Dartmouth as a pre-med, and quickly dropped pre-med after taking chem (3 -- not even 5 ) my freshman winter).  I'm now a senior, have only taken that one chem class, and haven't taken bio since I was a freshman in high school.  I NRO'd bio 2 because I was actually afraid I was going to fail it.  Because of this class, I'm now thinking about doing a post-bac so I can go to med school.  Prof. Witters is that great of a prof, and inspires that much passion for the subject in his students.  He is hands down the best professor I've had at Dartmouth, and I've have a lot of really wonderful professors.  Bio 2 is hard, but don't let the reviews scare you away!  If you put in the time, you will do well.  There are so many resources to help you succeed.  He podcasts his lectures (so helpful this term, when pretty much the whole class got swine flu) and posts extra notes online.  The TAs hold office hours (go to these! they are so under-utilitzed) and review sessions before exams, and Prof. Witters has office hours every day of the week, even the Sat. and Sun. of Thanksgiving weekend.  He also uses blackboard more than any other professor I've ever had -- optional interesting readings, a message board where you can post questions (and he will respond within hours, sometimes minutes, if an exam is coming up), and blogs, where the class works together on a challenging problem of human biology.  Your grade is four exams, non-cumulative, and weighted based on how many lectures each covers.  Participation (the blog, discussion board, going to office hours) can boost your grade if you're borderline, but it's mostly the exams.  The exams are challenging, but again, if you stay on top of the material and study as the course progresses you should be fine.  There's also bonus on every exam, and he's very generous with partial credit.  That said, if you don't know how to study, you might want to wait a year.  I know I really would have struggled in it freshman fall, since I didn't know how to study for a college class.  Bio 2 definitely isn't an easy class, but it's not nearly as hard as the reviews make it out to be provided you put in the work.  Like I said, I haven't taken bio in 7 years and was fine (despite taking four classes this term).  This really was one of the best classes I've taken at Dartmouth, with one of the best professors that teachers here.

Bio2 was one of the best courses I have taken at Dartmouth. I'm pre-med so admittedly the material was pretty straightforward for me but it has been the most interesting science class I have taken at Dartmouth and only helped solidify my desire to pursue medicine. It was really the only science class I have taken that made relevant connections to health, disease, and the human body.   While I could see the material being challenging for non-science majors/non-premeds, I encourage people to take it. Professor Witters is one of the best professors Dartmouth has and he wants all his students to succeed. His dedication to undergraduate students is unheard of and you wonder how he has time for everything else he does on campus, like pre-med advising, teaching at the med school, and also having a family. He has office hours everyday, even weekends, and answers questions on the Blackboard discussion board within about an hour of you posting.  There are so many resources to do well in the course podcasts, TA office hours, Witters office hours, practice quizzes and old exams on blackboard, along with supplemental videos/articles.   Take this course! You won't regret it!

Lee Witters is an absolutely wonderful human being.  He held office hours seven days a week and made me feel quite comfortable; he is an excellent listener.  He truly cares about his students and is seemingly omniscent about the material.  That being said, the course itself is ridiculous on a number of levels.  Years worth of material is packed into ten weeks.  The material is fascinating, which is why I chose the class in the first place.  I spent hours and hours each week studying the material, but the sheer volume of information is overwhelming.  Unfortunately, since there is so much information packed in, I was forced to focus on studying and memorizing instead deeply understanding and focusing on the fascinating material.  It is quite unfortunate that there is no introductory biology course.  This class is geared toward biology majors or non-majors who already have significant backgrounds in the subject.  As a freshman who hadn't taken biology since ninth grade, I struggled throughout the course.    I recommend taking this class only if you have some background in biology.  If you do not and decide to take it anyway, take other courses that are not as heavy.

I took this class because Witters recommended it at the first-year pre-health advising session for kids like me who hadn't taken bio since early in high school. I'm so happy I took his advice! Even though the class doesn't count for much in terms of pre-reqs, I would say it was extremely worth it. The content is pretty fascinating if you have any interest in how the body works, Witters is very enthusiastic, and the workload is minimal. If you're looking for a pretty easy, enjoyable science class, take this! If you're a freshman, this could be a good way to get excited about school.

It's a really interesting course that really hits home, and everyone should take it! But if you're not a science-y type, make sure to NRO or audit the class. That said, Dr. Witters and the TAs are really  helpful--it's scary how fast Dr. Witters replies to questions on the discussion board or class blogs(which you should participate in). He's super organized which makes it easier to learn. Tests were hard and you really have to learn all the details that Dr. Witters wants you to remember, but he'll always tell you exactly what you need to know and what you don't need to know. It was really great to learn about global health issues which he seems really passionate about (all of us should be).

I had taken three bio major courses prior to taking bio 2 (which I took out of interest), and I have to say that this course was much more work than the other bio courses I've taken. If anyone's considering taking this as a SCI distrib, I would recommend taking bio 11 with jack and peart instead; it's much easier and more meaningful. That being said, my opinion on this matter probably stems from the fact that I am inherently a science person, not a humanities or social science person. To me, this course seemed like a course in stamp-collecting, with pointless memorisation of anatomy, diseases, and symptoms with little scientific rigour in the explanation of those phenomena. I found myself simply MEMORISING information, instead of understanding the concepts and processes of human biology with any depth.  I guess this would be a good course for those who like memorisation without understanding, but I have to say that bio 2 was really not intellectually stimulating at all.

Prof. Witters is wonderful, responsive, and very knowledgeable.  He wants everyone to succeed and does everything he can to help people out.  The material was very interesting as well.  However, there was an insane amount of material covered throughout the course, and the exams required you to internalize all of it in incredible detail.  Take it if you love the topic and want to do a ton of studying to get a good grade, or I would suggest NROing it if you want want to study a lot.  But there are many easier ways to get a SCI credit.

Lee Witters is by far the most effective lecturer around.  If you have the chance to take any class with him, consider yourself lucky.    Since he put the lecture on podcasts, I never went to class.  I did quite well in the course though but I think that's just because I knew the material already.  There are loads of ways to understand the material  TA rewiews and quizzes, the book, the powerpoint, the podcasts, ample office hours; there are a lot of materials to look at.  The tests are very easy, too easy for all the stuff that we learned. There is multiple choice, matching, and some essays.  It's not hard to do well.  Very easy class for those of us with bio background.  Be prepared to compete with these people if you're a non-science major.

Professor Witters is a great lecturer and keeps the material interesting, which helps a lot in a biology class. The lectures were dense with information, but he simplified a lot of them. There was no homework for the class besides optional readings, which made the exams pretty hard if you didn't review the lectures substantially beforehand. Even so, there is a lot of help that's available during the class through office hours, Q&A hours, and the TAs.

Favorite Class this term by far, Lee Witters is an amazing teacher and lecturer. This was the first bio class that ive taken since 8th grade in middle school, and I had very little problems learning just about everything. Every exam I went into having studied each lecture from quick review slides, powerpoint slides (with my notes), and the TA review notes on harder stuff, and I left every exam feeling like i had gotten an A. In actuality I never got above a B on any exam despite how good I felt about the test. The tests are no some minutia of the subject but if you study youll remeber em. This is a great class to take and I strongly recomend it.

Wow, never has my curiosity in a subject material carried continuously throughout a course! Learning about human biology is so interesting because you're basically learning about yourself and others around you and how everything works. Also, Prof Witters is an incredible professor.

He uses powerpoint and all sorts of tech stuff. It's pretty neat. Plus the podcasts help a lot in reviewing his lectures.

Lee Witters is a great prof and an amazing lecturer. I like biology and I was excited to take this class, especially when everyone told me it was pretty easy. Not true. The only grades in the class come from the 3 exams, and unlike the lectures which stick to large topics, the exams ask really detailed and specific questions. I was really surprised by how tough the exams were because I studies a lot. Don't take this class if you're expecting an easy A.

Lee Witters is a wonderful professor and I would say this class is good for anyone who has an interest in Biology but does not plan to major in it.  Plus, you need to have really good study skills or you need to have taken a course that was similar to this one previously.  I learned a lot of info in class, studying, and even from Witters and his TAs, but I just couldn't pull through the exams.  They were so difficult for me (I didn't have a strong background in Biology anyway).  Other than that, a great and informative course.    GO TO OFFICE AND TA HOURS FREQUENTLY BECAUSE HE GIVES EXTRA CREDIT FOR THAT.

Professor Witters is widely acknowledged as one of Dartmouth's best profs. He puts an enormous amount of effort into his class and tries to ensure that each student feels interested, comfortable, and even appreciated as an individual. He insists that everyone attend office hours (he's in his office every day of the week except for Saturday), for example, and grades every exam himself, even though he has TA's.  With respect to the course itself loads of the material. But if you find biology interesting, then this class should interest you. Prof. Witters also includes unconventional perspectives, so that he asks us to consider the impact that biology has had on art and music.

This course ruined my fall. lectures were on itunes to listen to - i relistened to every lecture and took notes and studied key terms/topics and still got 55% on every test. If you aren't into science, dont take this stupid ass class. waste of time and prof. witters cant stop talking ever. he doesnt take a second to breathe. the guy is great but his class is impossible and he is a little unusual. just dont take the course, you will regret it.

If you are good at drilling things into your head and making them stick for exams you should be fine. If you're looking to learn more about the concepts and understand everything, this course is probably not for you. We went through too much material to look at anything in much detail.

I feel like I did learn from this class, however, my grade did not show it.  At all.  And now I have to take another SCI course.    If you're not a major, and are not used to science courses here at Dartmouth, I would advise you to take one that is much less difficult.
@

Be careful- this class is NOT for those who are looking for a SCI distrib or an easy class. A lot of people rave about Bio2 but it's NOT for everyone.  The tests are EXTREMELY hard- I have never studied so much for an exam and as a senior I've taken my share of difficult classes.  Witters does take Bio majors out of the curve. But most pre-meds are NOT bio majors. And the class is filled with pre-med students, some of who have already taken the MCAT and are looking to boost their science GPA. And there were many freshmen right out of AP bio.  Witters is a great guy and good teacher but this class is NOT worth it for those are just looking for an easy science distrib. It can really mess with your GPA since your brain isn't science oriented.

Bottom line biology is a lot of memorization. Luckily, I've had a good amount of background in both human and cellular bio before this, so it was more of a refresher course more than anything. Dr. Witters is a great prof--very energetic and teaches the course well...but we cover so much material that we don't really go too far in depth on anything.

His lectures are podcasted so i didnt go to class, i just listened when i had the time in conjunction with the power points. Overall, all you have to do is study 3 times for the 3 tests    and thats it. No homework etc.

Wow...looking at the reviews for this class you'd think this class is a life changing experience. Well, I can assure you, it most definitely is not. It's merely a standard bio class with a teacher who relies too greatly on power point slides and provides minimal depth to topics. People will tell you Lee Witters is the best teacher at Dartmouth and this is the best class they've ever taken. All I have to say in response to this is that I surely hope this is not the case. I'm in for a dull four years at Dartmouth if this is the case. Oh, I know, the guy's so funny and quirky and cool. No, he isn't. Seriously, it's not that good and definitely not worth taking a science class with upperclassmen majors.

Professor Witters is the most caring and helpful professor I'v ehad this term - he kind of set the barr high and will make all the other profs I have look pretty weak by comparison. He's really friendly, wants to help you do well, and explains everything really well so that us non-biologists can understand and get really interested (for people who take AP bio, this might be j/ review, i wouldn't know). He also brings a lot of humanity to the class, so you're reminded that while it's bio, it's also peoples' lives that are being affected.  There's a LOT of material to remember, and the class is kind of fast-paced, but the tests are pretty fair (2 midterms, 1 final, none are cumulative), and it's worth the effort to learn it all (he doesn't expect you to know every little detail either).  I don't know what my final grade is, but I can definitely say that what you take away from this course amounts to more than just a number on a page. Witters really makes everything come to life. Take this class - you won't regret it.

The course material is extremely interesting and applicable to "real life."  Professor Witters also gives very intersting lectures.    The exams may be a bit difficult for those with no bio background, but are by no means impossible.

Witters is an incredible lecturer. He made the material very interesting and provided multiple ways for students to understand the material.  In addition to the syllabus he had tons of office hours and put his powerpoint slides on line and he made podcasts of the last 11 lectures.  Great class

Bio 2 is a HUGE CLASS but Prof. Witters tries to give you all the tools in order to be able to succeed. He is not that good at explaining stuff and relies too much on his powerpoint slides. A very cool thing about the course is that HE HAS PODCAST, so he records himself and then posts all the lectures online and you can hear them on itunes or on your ipod. He gives you a quick review slide on all the information that you have to learn in each lecture for each exam, and you can hear the podcast in order to study. That being said, THE MATERIAL IS REALLY HARD.. If you don't like science I would think twice about taking this course. Even though, Prof WItters wants you to do well and is available for office hours everyday EVEN ON SUNDAYS, the exams cover HUGE AMOUNTS of material and it is just really hard to learn all of it. I don't regret taking the class but I think GPA wise I should have maybe considered astronomy or another class that is a easier science distrib..

This class covers a lot of information.  Don't be affraid, he doesn't get too detailed.  You should definitely study after each lecture or review at the end of the week because come test time you'll feel overwhelmed with information.
@
Lee Witters
/course/354
Prof Witters provides a great amount of study material, from lecture notes, to powerpoint slides, to online review quizes, to a blackboard discussion board.  There was no homework or textbook.  However, there is an insane amount of memorization for the tests.  You have to remember every single minute detail, because that's what he'll ask you about.  He doesn't quiz you on the "big picture" but rather on details of key concepts, and there are a lot to memorize.  So if you have a good memory and devote hours and hours to studying for tests, then this course might be a good one for you.  Personally, I didn't enjoy the midterms at all.

witters is an incredible prof, one of the best. outside of class he's involved with anything and everything medical here at dartmouth, from heading the nathan smith society to the biology department . in class hes a great lecturer, always available for office hours, great sense of humor, and really works hard to accomodate his students in every way. he will definitely work with you, he loves office hours, and he is SUCH an interesting guy. other than that, he's just a great guy and a great teacher. and bio 2 is an INCREDIBLY worthwhile course, especially to non-science majors. take it!

Of my three classes, this is my favorite class. Although it starts out with really basic stuff, this class is a great intro to science here at Dartmouth. It covers really interesting subjects; for example, after going over a body system such as the nervous system, Prof Witters would touch on the many diseases associating with it. This course has an awesome medical slant to it, suitable for those who wish to become physicians.  I loved this class, and I look forward to it most of the time. Prof Witters adds small stuff that makes the course INTERESTING, such as cartoons, songs, and Hemlich demonstrations. And he is available to students EVERY SINGLE DAY!!--he is the type of professor that makes Dartmouth so awesome.  And this course is not too hard; I have dozed off my share of the time, and I don't really study outside of class. The exams are very fair--just cram a lil' before the midterm.  One more thing--the TAs for this class are awesome; they prepare study material every week.   As a comparison, I also took Bio19 this term, and that class was a dull sleepfest compared to this class. Take this class and be inspired.

Professor Witters is the most amazing professor at Dartmouth.  He makes himself available to students for several hours seven days a week.  He is extreemly dedicated to making sure each student knows the material and that each student developes an interest in the material.

Bio 2 is an enlightening, worthwhile course. It covers various topics in human biology including biochemistry, physiology, endocrinology, immunology, public health, and some anatomy. Professor Witters knows a ton about human biology and is great at conveying this information to students. The course has three non-cumulative exams. The exams are fair, but they can be very challenging for students with little background in human biology. My knowledge from AP Biology made the material much more manageable. This course was extremely helpful in preparing for the MCAT.  I give it two thumbs up!

This course was really quite amazing.  Witters is an awesome prof and really explains the material really well.  Additionally, we had audio recordings of all the lectures on blackboard so you could basically relisten to lectures if you missed them or didn't understand them.  Witters had tons of office hours and really made you feel like he cared about teaching.  He prepared lecture outlines, quick reviews which basically told you what would be tested, and also posted the power point slides to print out on blackboard as well.  An amazing course which has inspired me to persue more bio and medicine. If you are at all wary of bio, or whether or not you are interested in pre-med, take this course! I don't think you will regret it!
@

Having taken AP Biology in high school and doing very well on the exam, I was expecting this course to be a giant review, and in essence, it was. However, the exams were extremely difficult and convoluted - a lot of the time I had to figure out what he was asking, and THEN figure out what the answer was (if I could get that far).   Going to class basically became a chore; Witters posts all the lecture slides online as well as podcasts of the lectures themselves, so you really don't need to attend. In fact, there's absolutely no incentive to go, because he doesn't take attendance and the class is huge (so not much discussion).  I would have liked this class much better if it were MUCH slower paced, and had discussion sections to go over the material in more detail.  It's an okay non-lab science distrib, but take a look elsewhere if you can.

Lots of people say this class is easy, but it's a ton of memorization and the exams are hard. I found that the majority of people who say this class is easy are bio majors or have had background in biology.  Coming in as a freshman, I was unprepared for the amount of information that would be on exams.  However, the material is interesting and the prof is great!
@
Lee Witters
/course/354
If you're at all interested at how the human body works and want a good easy 3rd class then take this class. People who say he relies on ppts too much obviously didn't pay attention because his lectures expanded on what was on them, he didn't just read off the slides. The tests are fine if you go to the TA review sessions and make flash cards. I didn't do any work outside the class besides the 3 days before exams and got an A-....

I loved this course. There was a ton of material--good if you like bio, but don't take it if you're not interested in the subject.

This was my favorite course at Dartmouth--take it!

It's funny, because I'm actually speachless. I really don't know what to say. I mean, this guy is absolutely the single greatest dissappointment EVER. He is soooo bogus, to put it lightly. He thinks he's so awesome with his little pony tail and his hippy music. Well, he sucks. "Hey come by my office and we'll listen to The Dead together. I'm so cool and chic and not old." No, you are old and most definitely not chic. He just walks around the room with his little gimmicks and he thinks he's so cool. He's not cool. In fact, he is the embodiment of everything that is not cool in the world. The worst part is all the complete tools sitting in the front row trying to kiss up, laughing at every joke, going to every office hour. These kids represent everything that is wrong with humankind. If you're reading this, you should be ashamed. Speaking of being ashamed, you should be ashamed if you sign up for this class. If you do, you get what you deserve. Get ready to study for over 50 hours for every completely lame mid-term. The worst part is that the tests are strictly memorization and involve no thought whatsoever. I got a very good grade in this class and I am telling you this from the most objective perspective possible. So, in closing, this guy sucks.
@
Lee Witters
/course/354
Whoa. I completely disagree with the "KILL ME NOW" reviewer. Witters is one cool dude, and I never sat in the front or went to office hours (though now I wish I had). Yes, it is a lot of memorization, but it is about YOUR BODY. This is good info to have. I'm writing this review a few months after the class ended, and at least once a week I've gotten to whip out what we learned about Tamiflu or starvation or muscle contraction and apply it to reality. So... fascinating info taught in an accessible fashion = lovely. The term after I took this, I took another intro bio class and it made me appreciate how much effort and interest Witters put in his class. And remember, just because a lot of us say it is awesome, don't think it is a gut. You WILL study a lot, but you'll also learn a lot, and you might even have a bit of fun.

I loveddd Bio 2 and I loveddd witters. I took this class for my science distrib because I had taken AP bio in h.s. Everyone should be required to take this course in my opinion. It was the most useful knowledge I have obtained at Dartmouth. Plus Witters is so enthusiastic- he genuinely loves teaching the material. There are three exams all of which are completely fair if you study. Id say start 3-4 nights before and go over the lectures piece by piece and you will be more than fine for the exams. Also- print out the slides before class to take notes on...it was the best way I found to study. Seriosuly, don't take a silly science class for the distrib when you can do well and learn such important info by taking this great class!

Witters is a great professor who makes all of the course information incredibly available and also makes himself very available to students.  The course is very accessible for non-science majors.

This class was fun and easy.  Dr. Witters is a fantastic guys and his classes are always well prepared and exciting.  Being a science major, this class was very easy, bordering on boring at times.

I thought Dr. Witters did an amazing job of introducing the material and helping the students understand it and prepare for the exams.  While the exams were challenging, I feel that he provided so many opportunities to study and get help with the material that the grade that I received really reflected how much I knew and how much effort I put into the course.  I think it would be really hard to find a professor more experienced and dedicated than Dr. Witters.  I hope to take another one of his courses in the future.

Professor Witters is an amazing professor.  He is extremely knowledgeable. This was a large class but he emphasized that he wanted to meet each person, and had office hours avaiable nearly every day.  Prof. Witters gave out lecture notes and posted the lecture slides online which made everything accessiable.  The TAs for the class were also great, and made lots of review material avaiable and were always willing to answer questions. Sometimes I got lost in the lectures because they covered a lot of material in a small amount of time. There are three exams. The exams were pretty tough, mainly because there was a lot of information to know, but they're a fair assement of the class.   This is a good class to take because it covers a lot of interesting material and Professor Witters great.

Dr. Witter's is really a great professor! He does absolutely everything possible to help you do well in his class, so if you do poorly, it's really all on you. He makes all of his power point slides available, provides lecture review slides (which he bases the tests off of), has TA weekly reviews and tests, and then a bunch of other random interesting stuff on blackboard. I didn't do much weekly homework at all and I didn't use the book at all after the first week because the lecture notes he provides along with the blackboard materials are more than adequate. Mainly you have to study hard for the tests and have a firm grasp on the material, but the tests were definitely fair. Dr. Witter's was truly a great lecturer though. He included insightful personal stories, history, and current events in most of his lectures and really related to students. He also keeps ridiculous office hours like everyday, even on weekends!

Professor Witters is perhaps the professor most dedicated to his students in the entire College - he even has office hours on the weekends! Witters takes a ton of information and boils it down to relevant, interesting, and important concepts that help you to better understand biology. His lectures are engaging and although paced sort of quickly, they're definitely manageable.  As a science major (but not biology) I found the first part of the course pretty easy since most of it was the basic scientific principles needed to understand biology. If you study a little for this course and keep up with the material, you should have no problem with it.   A good strategy for success in this course is to print off the lecture slides (everything is powerpoint) two to a page and take notes on them, highlighting key facts.   Don't buy the book - you don't need it at all.

First I am NOT a science person.  At all.  In fact, I was hesitant to take Witters's class...and I am SO GLAD that I did!  This class is so great because not only is the material information about your body that you should KNOW and are fascinting, but everything we learned was so relevant.  Witters is also the most enthusiastic lecturer and really knows what he's talking about.      There are 3 exams and they are not cumulative.  The courseload is very manageable as there is no reading nor any homework aside from lecture slides.  Witters puts all of his lecture slides/summary slides online along with past exams.  Because we did cover so much material, the TA reviews were key in pointing out which what was most important and would be tested.    Seriously--TAKE this course.  You wont regret it.

Bottom line you'll love Witters. He makes learning the material really easy. You can learn it from class, from slides posted online, or from comprehensive outlines he gives you.

The course was really interesting and I liked that it covered such a broad range of material. The only problem was that on exams, I thought there was a bit too much attention paid to incredibly specific details that were tough to memorize. I really liked the fact that the lecture notes and powerpoint were online, though. The only thing I would warn against is using these in place of going to class. Prof. Witters' lectures are really good, so you should go all the time anyway, and use the online resources as a backup if you must miss a class, or for review for the exams.

Though the lectures did go fast and there is a ton of material to be responsible for, the quality of the lectures made it all worthwhile. The textbook is supplementary at best -- I looked at it maybe once. The TAs provided very helpful weekly reviews and quizzes, and even if you were lazy like me and never went to the many many office hours Prof. Witters offered, he and the TAs still answered your questions on the online discussion board.   This class is tremendously relevant to life and though at times some of it was a little too "sciency" for me to fully grasp, it was all still possible to understand, esp. with all the help offered. The tests are difficult (pretty detailed and covering a lot of info) but fair. Prof. Witters truly wants people to do well and gain something from the class, which for me, is one of the best measures of a class' worth. You won't regret taking it!
@

I'm a non-major, but premed, and i thought the class was pretty easy. When he determines the grades, he takes out all the bio majors in the class. So, if you are a non-major, don't let the prospect of bio majors ruining the curve dissuade you from taking the class.  He posts his lecture notes and powerpoint slides online, but i'd definitely recommend that you go to class. He makes a lot of good points that aren't on the slides. You can, however, not buy the book and use the money to buy your girlfriend something nice. He tests only from his lecture notes, not from the book.  As a premed, i thought the tests were easy, but i know a few of my friends who aren't premed or bio majors, found them to be slightly difficult. Like I said, he tests straight from his notes and slides, and the questions are either multiple choice, fill in the blank, or short answer.  Witters is an excellent prof who goes out of his way to meet with students. He has a lot of office hours on almost every day of the week.  The only negative about this class is the class size, but that was to be expected.

If anyone else taught this class, it would run the distinct chance of being irremediably boring.  Professor Witters manages to get all the information across readily and memorably. He shows an extraordinary enthusiasm for teaching and for biology that is immediately apparent. He also is a huge Red Sox fan, which is a big plus. The book you're told to buy--don't buy it. Witters gives you everything you need in class. It's a nice resource, but if you print off all the slides and all the review materials, you'll be absolutely fine.  If you need a SCI distrib, take this course. it's not too difficult, but you feel like you actually learned something.

This class was very difficult for me.  It required an enormous amount of studying for exams.  Witters is great though.  he gives amazing lectures and keeps it interesting.  the exams were hard.  there's not much reading, but you have to do it or else you won't understand what's going on in class.

. . . ignore the reviews posted online that say this course was easy.  It's not.  It's conceptually easy, but there is waaaaaay too much crap to remember, which the TAs admitted several times.  Bio majors should find this interesting and easy, but for non-majors, even though it's fascinating, if you're looking for an easy SCI, take ENVS or something.  Bio 2 is cool but hard.  Witters rocks as always- definitely go visit him in office hours
@
Lee Witters
/course/354
I liked the class a lot.  But I am not a bio person, and took the class purely out of interest.  It was definitely more detailed than what I was looking for.  I think much of the problem stemmed from the fact that it's the only human bio class offered, so there are bio majors and pre-meds in the class, but also people who want what seems to be a basic bio class and people looking to fulfill a distrib.  I think it would better serve everyone if it were two classes- one class with really basic info for non-science people, and a second class that was a more detailed overview of human bio for bio majors and pre-meds.

Witters is an exceptional lecturer - his lessons are informative and interesting. The course itself is manageable and very straightforward.
@
Lee Witters
/course/354
Take this course.  Witters is great, and the material is good to know.  As science classes go, it seems to be on the easier side. One piece of advice take it seriously.  You don't have to buy the textbook, and there are no out of class readings.  I tended to blow bio off between exams, and then was stuck trying to cram 10 lectures in one night...not so much fun. If you space out material review and such though, it is a fair amount of work.  My friends who were in the class and actually managed their time well spent probably 3-5 hours a week outside of class and all got A's.

Proffesor whitters is great.  he makes bio 2 interesting with his enthusiasm for the subject.  the class of 216 students felt like a small seminar.  i would recommend this class to everyone.  take it whether you need it or not.

Prof. Witters is quite possibly the best in the whole college.  He is clear and concise in his lectures and always makes every subject something you can relate to.  Also, there is no homework so that's a plus.
@
Lee Witters
/course/354
Even though only I'm only a Freshman, I can say wholeheartedly that this is one of the best classes offered at Dartmouth.  Because the Professor is so dedicated to the class and his students, this is one not to be missed.  The fact that he holds Office Hours on the weekend speaks for itself; accessibility of the material and the instructor is excellent.  No Pre-meds should hesitate to take the class.  That said, it will be intensely rewarding to all.  The material is interesting and relevent to current-day events.  Tests do require some interpretation and/or critical thinking, which evaluates your grasp on the material; however, the Professor is very generous with partial credit.   Bio 2 is a model of a class.
@
Lee Witters
/course/354
Whether you're pre-med or a theater major, I recommend this class.  The material never gets overly science-y (i.e., very detailed or requiring you to have outside knowledge).  In a couple of areas, it helps to have a background (learning the major classes of molecules, the BASICS of respiration, etc), but, overall, it makes little difference.  So don't be intimidated.  Witters is also a great guy and I found myself eagerly anticipating class.  The class is so interestin that I, previously a tentative English major, am considering something in medicine.  So yes Witters is down-to-earth, concerned for his students, and an all-around caring person.  The class is not especially difficult (an A is not difficult if you study the review slides, which he provides and outline closely the material on the tests).
@
Lee Witters
/course/354
I definitely enjoyed this course.  Professor Witters is great, and it was an interesting subject.  One word of warning, the book is completely unnecessary, so don't waste your money.  The tests are based entirely on the lecture notes that he hands out.
@
Lee Witters
/course/354
Professor Witters is a good prof who really tries to make it interesting for his students. Though the class is big, he tries his hardest to make it seem smaller and more intimate.  The subject material was interesting but a lot of the exams is just memorization. If your looking for a good science class I would definitely recommend Human Bio.
@
Lee Witters
/course/354
This was definitely one of the better science classes I've taken here at Dartmouth. Prof Witters is a great lecturer and made class interesting with powerpoints supplemented by sound clips. Grading is a little rough because most of the class score pretty high on the tests. Some later material is covered a very rapid pace. However, Prof Witters makes himself very available for office hours.

An upperclassmen told me I should take this class, and after seeing its great reviews I decided to do just that. I am so happy I did! This class was amazing and I learned so much. Prof Witters is great and keeps you interested in the subject. There is a lot of material to learn, but the TAs for this class are great and help provide study materials. As well, everything you need to know is in the syllabus or on the slides, both of which you have copies of. This was definitely the best course I took this fall, and a great class to take freshmen fall. Take this class, you won't regret it!

Prof. Witters is awesome.  If you need to fulfill your SCI requirement, this is a great option.  There are only three exams, and you don't even need to buy the textbook.  Beware he claims that he will curve the non-bio majors, but there is no curve in the end because the non-bio and bio majors end up performing at the same level.  It's tough to do really well or really poorly in such a big class.

The prof was very effective and interesting but there was a lot of material covered in a short amount of time. The tests are not hard if you know all of the material well.  The TA's give great review material and as long as you put in the same amount of effort as your upper level bio classes, then you should be fine. I definitely think this class is worth taking if you are going to be taking the MCAT (the material basically covers the bio section of the test)

I personally think this class is a bit overrated. Lectures were good and covered the material but I wouldn't call them inspiring. Otherwise, Witters lives up to the hype--a terrific guy who honestly cares about his students (and the Red Sox)--about as much as I've seen at Dartmouth. You'll study a ridiculous amount of material for exams and then only be tested on a tenth of it, but you had better know it all well.
@
Lee Witters
/course/354
Prof. Witters is one of the best science lecturers I've had here--usually they are very dull and dry but Witters had an incredible sense of humor. He constantly makes jokes, shows videos, gives out prizes during class, invites guest lecturers, does in-class demonstrations, etc, etc. Class is hardly ever uninteresting because of Dr. Witters. He also does a great job of historicizing science as well as bringing up some contemporary issues. There are two midterms and a noncumulative final. They are all doable so long as you study in advance. The text is optional--it's sufficient to just study from the power point lectures if you take good notes. Only down side about the class is that the last third of it goes by really fast. He tries to cover some of the major biological systems--respiratory, digestive, cardiac, etc. all in a matter of a few weeks and zooms by the last couple of lectures. Final exam is also quite detailed. However, this class is still worth taking, even for and especially for nonscience majors who need the distrib.
@
Lee Witters

This is a must-take class.  You learn about all the functions of the body and what can go wrong with them so you know what's really happening with you or a family member or in the news.  Prof. Witters is a fabulous lecturer with awesome power points.  I didn't have the best experience 1-on-1 (he was kind of initmidating) during office hours but he's clearly an amazing prof...one of the best at Dartmouth.  It's not hard throughout the term but exams are really really hard so study up but definitely take this class.
@
Lee Witters

Professor Witters really inspires an interest in biology by demonstrating how important understanding the subject is to our everyday lives. There is no work for this class besides studying for the exams. The exams are challenging; he expects you to know a lot of detail. Overall, however, a great course even if you are not a bio major.
@
Lee Witters
/course/354
Few would disagree that Lee Witters is one of the best professors at Dartmouth.  He loves teaching and it really comes through in the way he engages students during lectures.  He makes himself available to students pretty much every day, through sign-up office hours.  He's even available on Saturday and Sunday mornings.    As for the difficulty of the course, I personally, in my senior fall, did not find it to be too difficult (I have taken other bio classes previously).  But I do know that some underclassman struggled a bit through the course, especially if this was their first bio class here.  There is no lab but there is a lot of material to learn on the powerpoints (textbook is optional; I did not buy it) if you are not familiar with a lot of the concepts coming into the class.    Overall, I highly recommend this course to anyone, perhaps especially to non-bio/non-pre-med students because it teaches you a lot about your body and lifestyle.  But don't immediately dismiss this as a "gut" class just because the number is low.

BIO2 with Witters is a must-take for all. He's so passionate about the material and inspires his students to be so as well. Even in a 216 person class, Witters manages to get everyone involved with interactive demonstrations and trivia games, where he gives away fun prizes. The information you'll learn in BIO2 is useful in every life. For the majority of the term, there's not much work, since the one textbook is optional; however, when each of the the three exams comes around, a good amount of time is necessary to fully review the enormous amount of information he gives you. Witters is super direct about what you need to know, so there's no confusion or hesitation in that manner. He has loads of office hours, as well as fabulous TAs who are constantly working to help you. Winning Prof. of the Year was well deserved.

Lee Witters is no doubt one of the best professors at Dartmouth.  His knowledge about the subject is incomparable, and he is always available for help---he was even available during every weekend!  I've never heard of a professror more willing to help his students than this Dr. Witters  However, for me, the course was extremely difficult, especially since I am not a biology major, or pre-med.  You do have to study hard and effectively to do well in this course.  Nonetheless I would recommend this course to everyone--I belive that this is the best course to fulfuill your SCI dsitributive requirement.

I took the course because I needed the science credit, and it's one of the best courses outside my major I could imagine taking.  I learned more than I typically do in a single course.  Witters shows consistent commitment to making this work for the students. The class is too large (late students often couldn't find seats), but prof compensates with applaudable lecture style.

as with most survey courses, this class had a lot of material to cover. I would say that's the course's biggest weakness. although the lectures were entertaining and professor witters is one of the better profs I've had, I still felt like I got very little out of the lectures. if I had to do it again, I probably would not have taken this course, but prof. witters gets an A for effort.
@

/course/354
Professor Witters is an excellent professor; he genuinely wants every student to do well in his class and he is willing to do whatever it takes to help you succeed, provided that you are willing to put in the time and effort.  His lectures are very interesting and the powerpoint slides that accompany them are helpful in reinforcing the concepts that he is discussing. The reading for the class is a packet of notes that he wrote, which are written to help even the most science-phobic people understand the subject.  The exams are not super easy, but if you study and attend class then you should have no problem.
@

Please, if you don't need to take this class, don't do it. The class is huge, which makes it impersonal. The lectures got a bit hard to understand at some points. It was impossible to flag down a TA for help. This class was too much stress and way too time-consuming. The exams were hard and unbelievably detailed. I would recommend anyone who likes their sanity to stay away.

I am a non-major but have always been interested in science.  Since I haven't taken any science classes in such a long time, this was a nice way to get back into that field.

This course is not particularly challenging for those who took and excelled in AP Bio in high school and definitely would not be challenging for many life sciences majors.

Professor Witters was the only professor that I can actually say was wholeheartedly dedicated to his job.

Prof. Witters is one of the best professors I've had at Dartmouth.  He's interesting, funny, and has office hours all day every day.  There is a lot of material on each of the three (non-cumulative) exmas, but it is interesting because he tailors the class to current topics in biology.  Textbook optional-- and not necessary because he gives great lectures.  TAKE THIS CLASS.

I am not a bio major, but this class almost made me wish I had been.  Prof. Witters is a superb professor and has office hours 7 days a week.  He probably has the most official office hours of any professor on campus, and he's a medical doctor, in addition to being a lecturer.  His lectures are to-the-point and his powerpoint slides are actually helpful and concise.  The info we learn is fundamental for daily life, as we learn about common diseases and health problems.  Because of the way he has set up the class, you don't even have to go to the lectures, because everything you need to know is posted online in the powerpoints and also in the lecture summaries.  There are three non-cumulative midterms which are all fair, but not simple.  Prof. Witters also posts last year's exam to help you prepare.  Our TAs were amazing and gave us review materials every week, online quizzes and other practice quizzes.  They also held review sessions before every exam.  I highly recommend this course to anyone looking for a Science credit.

Basically, this class has all the necessary components of a really great class. Prof. Witters is entertaining, lively, and always available outside of class. He provides students with so many study resources that, provided you study, you can do very well. There is no required work outside of class other than studying for the two midterms and the final, all of which are curved. Finally, this course focuses heavily on human diseases and is therefore really interesting and applicable to most people's lives-I know several peple afflicted with some of the diseases we covered and it was nice to learn more about them. Studying for this class isn't painful- This has been my best class at dartmouth thus far, despite not being a science person!

This course was amazing! Prof. Witters was always available (including 8 am every Saturday morning!) and inspired interest for the subject. His use of visuals and audio clips (whoever thought that Homer Simpson could pop up in a biology lecture?)was great (and often times hilarious). The TAs provided weekly quizzes and midterm/final reviews, and were incredibly nice! The material was fairly easy to learn and, most importantly, it was interesting!  If you take only one biology class at Dartmouth, choose this one!

Professor Witters is so enthusiastic about the subject it's hard not to enjoy it. His life demonstrations are anything but boring, and his love for powerpoint is obvious and a GREAT help because the slides are always accessible online.

This course was great. The only thing unpleasant about it was the large size of the class, but Witters is so available for help, so interesting, and gives great lectures. He knows what is interesting to studnets and teaches to that.  There is a lot of material to learn in this class and tests cover it all, but he gives you tons of advance warning to seek help and lets you know what is on the tests way ahead of time. Also, there is no homework in this class besides keeping up to date on reviewing for tests. I highly reccomend this class.

this class is a must, in my view it should actually be required. you learn things about YOUR body that are facinating. i put in much more hours then the average student but also did very well. there are 3 tests that are not cumulative. if you study throughout the term and dont wait till a day before the test you can do very well.

This was the best taught class I have ever taken.  Witters sincerely wants his students to learn, and his lectures are both interesting and informative.

There is no book for this class; there is no homework.  Lee Witters IS Bio 2; his lectures and his notes are the class in its entirety. Have no reservations about this aspect of the class.  His lectures are almost always interesting- if you dont appreciate the content, you will appreciate the bizarre but relevant patient histories, the humorous demonstrations involving members of the class, and the yankee baiting, all of which come up fairly frequently.  No need to take many notes during his lectures- the notes he gives you beforehand correspond almost exactly to his lecture, and he posts beforehand the powerpoint slides he is to use during class. The content of this class is relevant because he highlights a lot of things that will interest students- the bio of working out, of contracting STDs.  He also relates many topics to world health, his pet cause.  If you are interested in talking to him about the class, world health, or anything else, he is available almost every day of the week outside of class. My only compliant is that, b/c there is no homework, the lecture always takes the full class period, so there is little room for dialogue.  But Prof Witter's availability outside of class more than makes up for this.
@
Lee Witters
/course/354
all hyperbole aside, Dr. Witters has to be a serious contender for the "Best Prof at Dartmouth" title, and Bio 2 has "Best Class" hands down.  If you're pre-med, and or have even the most remote interest in a health-related field, **you have to take this class.**  Change your major, change your D-plan, skip an FSP/LSA, take a 4-class term -- do any or all of these if you have to in order to be able to take this class.  Having this class has made studying for the MCAT infinitely easier and really served to further solidify my interest in medicine.  Dr. Witters is truly inspiring as a prof, and works into the course not only the relevant biological topics, but also current political and socioeconomic topics as they relate to medicine and the availability of medical care worldwide.  Three non-cumulative exams compose your grade, each very do-able if you've kept up.  The final is the most demanding as far as exams go, covering 11 lectures, and you won't do well if you wait until reading period to start cramming.  (Interesting to note  he claims in the syllabus that in assigning grades he adjusts for bio majors in the course in the final curve, but never explicitly states how that's done.)  There's a wealth of study materials made available, of which the practice exams are by far the most helpful.  Very possible to get an A without buying the required textbook.  In fact, b/c of it's high price tag and the fact that everything you really need to know Dr. Witters covers in lecture, I'd really advise against buying it.  Any important figures are in his PowerPoints, all of which are posted on BlackBoard they week before so that you can take notes directly on the slides during lecture (very helpful!)  Finally, and to many of us most importantly, Dr. Witters is without question the most accessible/available prof I've ever had.  He would make himself available for office hours every day of the week, including coming in on the weekends to answer questions.  He's really a special prof and you're seriously missing out if you don't take at least one class with him while you're here.  It's a damn shame he can't teach more of the pre-med bio courses... or all of them for that matter... nobody else even comes close.

This class should be taken by everybody.  Witters is awesome, really nice, enthusiastic, very willing and able to help you.  He makes these elaborate power point presentations for each subject that are fun and informative.  The information is so relevant to us, to our time.  You learn about the advancements in medicine and all about diseases.  Even if you are not pre-med or remotely interested in biology, it is still a really good class to take.  There are two midterms and a final, and all you need to do is read the lectures and take a look at the slides, which he makes available online.  You really do not need to go to class, but the classes are honestly really enjoyable and worth attending, if not to prepare better for the exams, just for one's general good.

Dr. Witters is simply an amazing professor.  I've never taken a class with a prof that puts so much effort into his class.  He is available for office hours 7 days per week (yes, even on the weekends) and is always ecouraging students to come talk to him because he really wants to help you improve and learn the material.  I hate most sciences (especially biology) and yet this was one of the best classes I've taken at Dartmouth.  If you need an SCI or just are interested in how the human body functions, this is a fantastic class.  Take it, you won't regret it.

Dr. Witters is one of the most tremendous and dedicated teachers I have ever experienced. Although the class is extremely large, he makes a huge effort to get to know everyone in the class by making office hours available basically 7 days a week. His lectures are very effective although he does go very quickly. The good part though is that there are tons of resources to reference for answers if you do not understand a specific part of the lecture. The class grade is based on 3 exams each weighted according to how many lectures they cover. I highly recommend this class--it is the only class all about you!

This was a great class with a great professor.  Powerpoint could get a little boring to look at after a while.  If you are a looking for a class with no required reading, this would be a good choice.  However, the tests are harder than most would expect.  Take this class, or any other class with Prof Witters, if you have the chance

This has been one of my favorite courses at Dartmouth.  The material is interesting and applicable to every day life.  Mr Witters is a terrific prof, one of the best I've had.  Easy to talk to, very available out of class, and in class he makes the lectures captivating and fun.  And I'm an English major!  I'd recommend this course to everyone.

Lee Witters is a wonderful lecturer and a dedicated prof (he has office hours 7 days a week).  This class gives an interesting, informative overview of human biology, but really Witters is the reason everyone should take this class; he is just great.  Plus, there is no work except to study for the 3 exams.

I absolutely loved this class.  Professor Witters is a wonderful lecturer who puts a great deal of thought and effort into the material he presents and how he presents it.  He was always available for office hours and tried to make the material as comprehensible as possible for all involved. The weekly question and answer sessions were particularly helpful for clearing up anything that might not have been fully understood in class.  Even the movies shown were helpful in better understanding the material.  I'm definitely not a bio major, but I would recommend this class to anyone with even a mild interest in how the human body works.  I initially took this in order to fulfill a distributive requirement, but now I'm extremely grateful for having taken this class.  The material is interesting and very relevant.  I could not have asked for a better experience.  Take full advantage of all the resources offered by this class  office hours, Q&A sessions, movies, TA reviews, blackboard discussion board, and the classes themselves.  I promise if you are even somewhat interested in the way the human body works, this class won't be too much work and you won't dread going to class or studying for it.  Both bio majors and total non-science people rave about it.  Take it and you won't regret it.

Witters was a great prof, very receptive to questions.  His lectures were well organized, and he spoke engagingly, using jokes and anecdotes.  He had SO MANY office hours too!  there should never be a problem with finding him.  Outside of the class setting he is a great person too.  For some reason though, i didn't like the class.  It was a bit too much like some of the high school bio I had already done, and it really wasn't interesting.  I think the class tries to cover too much material--consequentially, we covered a lot of subjects only superficially and I was left with a lot of questions that the course couldn't cover.    Its a good class for someone interested in learning some basic biology, but it's not a supereasy class to get the SCI distrib in either.

5 star class.  Lee Witters is great.  He is hilarious and gives clear, interesting lectures.  It is good information to learn, but it is a lot to memorize for the tests.  I'd recommend it to anyone, even though i don't usually take science classes.

Prof. Witters def made the course. His lectures were interesting and very thought out. You can tell that he's gone through the material quite a few times. Good for those looking to get a general overview of the human body and those non-science people who want an easy sci distrib.
@
Lee Witters
/course/354
I'm sure all the other reviews have already trumpeted Witters' effective teaching style and his mastery of powerpoint, so I'll keep it short  To make a class of about 200 feel like a small lecture, that truly has to say something about the job that he does.  As a non-major, I completely recommend this class (he also removes Bio Majors from the curve when calculating exam grades).  If you still have an SCI to fill, take it the next time it is offered.  Or just take it anyway.

Prof. Witters is awesome.  His class was definitely a lot of fun.  I enjoyed his PP presentations.  He picked music that was great, like "Sexual Healing" for the lecture on reproduction.  It was a lot of fun, not a lot of work, and very interesting. I took this course because I heard he was a good professor and that certainly true!  Take this course if you can, it's a blast.
@
Lee Witters
/course/354
The course was more difficult than I expected it to be.  It required a good amount of focus and attention to detail.  The lectures covered many different topics which were sometimes hard to understand because they were unrelated.  Though Witters says that he only emphasizes the "big idea" on his tests, you are required to memorize a great amount of detail because his exam questions were very specific.  Basically you [are] expected to know everything about anything he covers.  Witters and the graders are very picky about grading the exams.  Though you might explain a concept well and accurately on the exam, if you don't use the key words that Witters expects you get little or no credit for your answer.

I'm very glad that I took this course, and I would recommend it to any student.  It covers a very important subject, your body and your health, and is the only class at Dartmouth that is all about you.   Professor Witters is a great lecturer, very accessable, and willing to do everything to help students succeed in this class.   If I were choosing classes again for this term knowing what I know about the course, I would definitely take this course over again!

Prof. Witters gives awesome lectures.  He uses a lot of powerpoint slides and sound clips that keep the class going.  He makes himself available almost everyday outside of class for extra help.

Professor Witters is a great professor.  He is excited about teaching and inspires the students to learn.  The information itself was interesting but Witters made the course work.  True, the course covers a lot of information and you have to go over the material everyday but Witters makes it a point to be available for  his students.  He has walk-in office hours on the weekend and loves to help his students one on one.  Even if you don't love bio, you will love this course.

Prof. Witters is fun, interesting, and has great AV stuff in his lectures.

Both biology and non-biology majors would benefit from this course, especially people who are pre-med.

Bio 2 is a multimedia experience, complete with powerpoint, movies, sounds, demonstrations, special guests, and halloween candy.  The topics are relevent to life, and the material vast, but attainable.  Need a new appreciation for human bio?  sign up for this class.
@
Lee Witters
/course/354
Witters might be one of the most dedicated profs at Dartmouth.  He does millions of other things, but his dedication to Bio 2 is incredible.  He really wants everyone to understand the material, and this shows in his availability for office hrs (during the week and on sat+sun mornings)  the material is interesting, and usually everyone ends up cramming before the exams.  On the last exam there was a lot of material, and it can get annoying that he expects knowledge of small details on the exams.  it's a great class (nice for showing the big picture of bio), and not too difficult if you put time in(obviously better if you do this gradually, but cramming can still get you a good grade).  Witters is likely one of the best bio dept profs.

The waste of class time by the professor really frustrated me. If you're serious about learning the language, don't take it with this professor. Otherwise, you might get stuck with a bunch of uninspired and apathetic freshmen who are taking the class just to fulfill the language requirement, which was what happened to me.
@

I had lost interest in French in 12th grade, but this class really renewed my love for the language. Professor Mosenthal is amazing! She is incredibly patient and supportive, and she is always willing to help you understand the material. If you need to take a language and you are interested in French, try to take it with Prof. Mosenthal!
@

obviously any class that includes drill every day before the sun has risen isn't most of our cups of tea.  however, if you need to take french II take it with mosenthal.  she's very engaging and not very difficult.  she makes intro language enjoyable; but the class is dull and quite onerous by nature.
@
Brigitte Mosenthal
/course/1275
Mosenthal is great, but the book is mediocre.  It does not include everything that she tests, especially exceptions to the rules of the language.  Her quizzes are straightforward.  The only complaint I would have is that she does not communicate your grade on homework assignments well.    Make sure you go in and meet with her during office hours.  It helps a ton, she will remember you when giving you a final grade, and she will offer to look over your quizzes before you turn them in.

Prof. Mosenthal was a great teacher. If you did well in french in high school, you'll have no problem in this class. I think the weekly quizzes were very fair; if you didn't understand something, Prof. Mosenthal was always available in office hours. Definitiely not a stressful class unless you have no previous french experience, in which case, you'd probably have to study a lot since we never really went over vocab.

Great first college French class after high school French. I already knew most of the material but it was good to have a review. Mosenthal is much better than my high school teacher, so no complaints there. Probably the only thing that detracted from the appeal of this course was morning drill.

Chances are, if you are planning on taking French 2, you are just doing a review of the profs.  Mosenthal was a really great prof for French 2, which essentially covers the same material no matter which prof you take it with.  She is very friendly and accommodating, and doesn't test on anything unfair.  She inspired good class dynamics and I'd say that overall my French 2 experience was a good one (and there wasn't much work).

This course requires that you dedicate a good hour daily to studying. Its not a hard course but you really have to pay attention in class because most of thrclass is in french.

Madam Mosenthal is wonderful. She is very helpful and understanding. This was a typical language class as far as the material goes. Mosenthal had the class do skits each week. You got to pick your own groups and they were pretty fun. There are quizzes every week but no midterm. The quizzes are pretty easy if you keep on top of your French. I didn't like my French 1 class very much so this was definitely a huge relief. I liked going to class every day.

Prof Mosenthal definitely made this course very low-key and enjoyable. She's totally understanding and reasonable with grading. Basically if you do the work, you get the grade. She always responds to any questions in class as soon as they arise. She also uses lots of hands-on examples/interactions with vocab and grammar so class isn't boring. You do skits once a week which are not as intense as they sound, so don't stress. Quizzes once a week which are very straight forward, and a final exam. (No midterm!) The downer... drill 5 days a week. But most drill instructors are pretty chill, so it's not too painful & your french totally improves by speaking it so often in class/in drill.  Def take Mosenthal's class if you have a choice between another prof.
@
Brigitte Mosenthal
/course/1275
French 2 is pretty much just grammar, so it covers a lot but isn't hard. Mosenthal was very good at teaching and explaining the material, and was nice and approachable. There were quizzes and skits every week, which were both pretty easy, and just the final exam. Attendence is a big part of it-- she only allowed 3 absenses from class and drill combined. I found the class enjoyable and think Mosenthal is a great prof for French 2.
@
Brigitte Mosenthal
/course/1275
I don't know what it was, but I did not learn french form this teacher.  A typical week included drill at ungodly hours of the morning and me having no idea what to study for the quiz. I don't know what it was, but I had to basically teach myself french in this class.  I didn't find Prof. Mosenthal's lectures useful in learning the material.  I've had trouble with french in the past, and came into the class knowing that I was goign to have to work damn hard to get a decent grade.  I did the work, I went to drill, I got B's on most of the tests, and still did horribly on the cumulative final.  so yeah, if french is a problem for you, beware this course; it will not shed any further light into an already dim subject.  but, if you generally "get" french and took another french class recently, you'll do fine in this class.
@
Brigitte Mosenthal

Mosenthal is a great prof. who is not only interested in how her students do in class, but she takes an interest in our interests and personalities outside of class. Her lectures are interesting and to the point, and as cheesy as it sounds, she does make learning fun. From games that review grammar to creating stories that help spoken French to French films, I learned a lot in this course. Her exams are not simple, and do require studying, but even though they can be tricky they just force you to be on top of it.
@
Brigitte Mosenthal
/course/1275
I really enjoyed this class.  It was not as difficult as I expected and Mosenthal provided us with ample time to review the material that was presented in French 1.  Her lectures were very organized and clear and she was very responsive to students' questions.  My only complaint is the fact that we had to take our weekly quizzes online on Blackboard.  This proved to be rather difficult, because we were given a 30 minute time limit and it was easier to make spelling and grammatical mistakes when we had to type our answers in to such a small space.  The benefits of taking the quizzes online over the weekend were that we had more time to study and they did not interfere with class time.  Mosenthal is a great professor and she's very flexible -- when people complained about taking the quizzes online, she gave us the option of taking them on paper if we preferred.

If you took French in high school, then this French class shouldn't seem much different.  The main focus was grammar, and as long as you attended class (or learned the grammar out of the book) then it was a fairly easy course.

Honestly-french 2 was great. We had tests at the end of every unit which is A LOT better than a mid term. We had to write and memorize and then perform a skit every week, but it definately lifted my grade along with everyone else's. Ms. Mosenthal's awesome too. )
@
Brigitte Mosenthal
/course/1275
Since you had to have at least a little training in French, this course shouldn't be too hard to understand.  You only learn one or two new grammar uses through the week, and the final exam was only on grammar.  It tested virtually no vocab.  As long as you pay attention, you'll do great in the course.

I wish I had had more time to spend on this class as I really enjoy French.  The requirements seemed easy at the beginning of the term (weekly quizzes/skits, one final test), but quickly expanded to writing things on some forum to French people who didn't want to respond, and almost daily homework assignments. Still not too much work.  The quizzes featured a lot of translation from English to French (which does not seem to be intuitively in line with the philosophy that you should be able to think in French). Quizzes for the most part were fairly hard, the amount of studying I did never seemed to correlate with the grade I got though, it was more about previous French experience.  Que sera... Skits weekly were a burden too, especially since they were group graded.  make sure you get a good group (ie not slackers like I had, as mme mosenthal is unsympathetic to group problems in grading).  Overall, my French improved, Mme. Mosenthal was a good prof, but seemed to have a lot of extraneous requirements that did NOT help me learn French.

Probably your typical French II class, but prof. mosenthal managed to make it interesting and not too painful, even at 9 am. She gives weekly quizzes and there are weekly group skits and a final exam. All challenging, but fair. Overall a good class and a friendly and engaging prof.

Drill makes this class time consuming, but otherwise it's very managable. Also, Professor Mosenthall's lectures on grammar are helpful, but sometimes the material was not taught until the day before the weekly test. The weekly tests were good to keep on top of the material. Overall-- Professor Mosenthall is a good prof to take this class with.
@

Well, I'm one of those that had high school French, but hadn't spoken or seen a word of it for two years before I stepped into class the first day.  Unfortunately, that meant that I was competing with freshmen who had five years of high school french before coming here.  Soooo the balance was a little off, but it was okay.  It was standard language format  lecture-style class on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and a quiz every Friday.  Quizzes were pretty fair, but you're going to struggle through the first few unless you're up on your vocabulary.  Professor Mosenthal is super nice, although sometimes she does digress on certain grammar points and doesn't explain them fully enough for the quizzes.  Overall an effective lecturer, though.

Professor Mosenthal definately has favorites in her classes and it is clear after the first few classes who they are. During my class they tended to be the male athletes. She favors these students and is far more easy going and helpful with these students. She is very hard to talk to and even confrontational at times. She did not like me, and despite my hard work in the class and understanding of the material i think this definately affected my grade.  There are so many other great french profs at Dartmouth- definately take one of their classes insteaed.

I had a blast taking this class.  Anna is the best language teacher I have ever had--she is fun, engaging, funny, always available, and pretty much is the ideal professor.  I really got to know the other people in my class and actually enjoyed class time.  Italian 2 as a course can get a little boring just because it is a lot of grammar but if you want to learn how to speak the language, you just have to do it and taking it with Anna makes it all worth it.  Great class!!

Italian 2's pretty boring in that it's all grammar. It can get really tedious... that's why it's so nice to have Anna. She know's it's boring, and she tries to keep everyone awake by being very engaging in class. She's also a great person, period. Take it with Anna!

Honestly, the material covered in Italian 2 is very boring. Mostly grammar and sentence structure. But Anna makes the class so fun! You can tell that she really enjoys teaching and loves her students. She explains the material like a pro, and there is very little confusion, even with complex concepts. If you want to take a language or want to go on an lsa/fsp, this is most definatley the way to go!

If you've taken French before coming to Dartmouth, this class is good for review. If your only French background is French I at Dartmouth, it will be challenging.  So many people in the class had taken the language before that  Professor Cone sometimes rushed through lessons. It was frustrating at times.

Much harder than French II, lots of grammar.  Class is a waste of time, but Cone is pretty funny.  Quizzes were very tough, but the writing assignments were very enjoyable.

Professor Cone is a wonderful teacher who is a lot of fun in class. She is also very helpful and willing to see students who want outside help. Her tests were fair. There were a few compositions that we had to do but they were manageable. I would recommend Professor Cone highly for this course.

I don't know where they got the idea that speaking in the language that you're teaching is helpful. I did not know what was going on half the time, and if I had a question, I felt uncomfortable asking because the prof would scoff at my sucky accent, and chastise me for using english if I couldn't say it in French. Going to class was completely pointless- I would have learned more just looking at the textbook for an hour each morning instead
@
Annabelle Cone
/course/1275
Out of all my fall classes, this was the one I actually dreaded. It might have been something about the fact that it was a 9 or also because I had morning drill, but this class was NOT inspirational by any means. The prof is a bit crazy and says off the wall comments on a regular basis. Despite this, she was very approachable and willing to meet during office hours. French 2 classes in the fall are loaded with eager freshman who just took French in high school, so if you haven't taken French for a while or you just started and are continuing with the second course, you might want to wait and take it a different term. The professor made assumations about the class and seemed to forget that some of the students had only been studying French for one term or so.

French 2 is basically all grammar. Professor Cone is a good prof for this course, though I feel like anyone could have taught this course well. Class is a big waste of time because all you do is spend a lot of time learning something that could be learned in 5 minutes on your own.   Exams are pretty easy. Read the book, study before exams, and you'll be fine!
@
Annabelle Cone
/course/1275
I had taken French in high school before, so this was a breeze.  But Prof. Cone is excellent.  She speaks not just so that you understand but also so that you LEARN.  If we're going over the subjunctive, she won't just use it a lot, seh will emphasize the endings and make sure that you hear it, so she actually helps you listen for the differences, which is a step toward burning the language into your brain.  The tests are fair, the grammar is straightforward.  For people who are fairly new to French, the course DOES move fast, so keeping up would require some extra time, and in that case the out-of-class workload is probably tripled, depedning on how fast you learn languages.  Required homework is non-existant (except for 2 one-page assignments), except for drill.  Word of advice...know the grammar before coming into drill.  Drill sucks if you're not prepared, but if you are then it might actually help.  A little bit.  All in all the course does exactly what it set out to do.  And you can't go wrong with Prof. Cone.

Cone is a crazy woman.  She titters on and on about the outrageous things that run through her weird little mind.  She obviously had a dream of becoming some kind of comedian, which she tries to carry out in class with horrible, uncomfortable results. She's a nice woman, but just a little on the cuckoo side. If you've taken any french course in high school, this class will be extremely easy. don't expect much help from cone for understanding new grammar points, though...it's best to just ask your drill instructor for help. The only work you really have to do for the class is skits and three compositions.  The skits are COMPLETE bullshit for one, we had to introduce a proverb and then perform a skit that had to do with it. instead, my group and i made up 5 ridiculous, nonsensical "proverbs" and stated them in a row, claiming it was a poetry slam.  She loved it. The compositions are easy as well, as long as your grammar doesn't suck too badly.

I thought this class was very inefficient. It would take an entire period to learn one or two grammar points that I felt like I could have learned by looking at the book for 5 minutes. It's annoying that attendance is required for this reason.    The homework didn't really help me learn new things; it woudl have been better if we had exercises to complete rather than skits and compositions to write.

@
Annabelle Cone
/course/1275
Professor Cone is enthusiastic and very fair. There is basically no homework except the occasional composition which is at most one page long. We had 3 quizzes, a midterm, a final, and 4 skits. Prof Cone grades very easy though and if you've had any advanced French in high school this class will be a breeze. Your drill instructor enforces all grammar points learned and studying is minimal. We began the course with future and moved through imparfait, conditionnel, plus que parfait, and conditionnel passe. I would definitely recommend taking this course when you need an easier 3rd class; there is a lot of class time because of drill everyday, but that is it! I would also recommend Prof Cone...
@

Show up to class and drill, study, and do your homework.  It is a great class, with a great teacher.  We always covered all of the material in class, and had *interesting* class discussions (about random things, like french riots, nudity in california, Texas A&M vs. UT, etc.    You will have a lot of fun with Prof. Cone, she is a great teacher!  Pay extra attention when she goes over grammar - she can move very quickly and efficiently in class.  If you dont pay attention, you will fall behind fast in class.

French is great and Prof Cone is a funny lady.
@
Annabelle Cone
/course/1275
At this level of the language, French is quite dull as you have to learn tons of grammar and stuff.  Therefore, the class could have been completely awful.  Luckily, Professor Cone is a great teacher.  She gives good lectures, has a friendly personality, and best of all assigns several creative assignments that are both fun (though somewhat time-consuming) and help pull up your grade.  She grades pretty fairly, although the tests were not always well-balanced- I think the imparfait tense was on every test.  Prof. Cone also encourages (sometimes forcefully) the use of French rather than English in class discussions.  Overall, she is the best French teacher I've ever had.  Drill- this class has drill every day, either early in the morning or around five pm.  So that sucks.  On the other hand, you can make good friends and drill.  My instructor was Kelly Fender, and I highly reccomend her.

Professor Cone makes palatable the dry specifics of French grammar.  She is resourceful as well, providing handouts to clarify points on which the textbook was weak. She also was not a slave to the textbook, omitting superfluous material.    She is not the hardest grader, and emphasizes compositions and skits in addition to the regular quizzes and exams.  Cone is a genuinely nice, if slighty eccentric, professor.  Look forward to in-class crêpes, and the occasional hilarious ancedote.

/course/1275
Stark will only teach you grammar. You do not learn how to speak French, only how to write and say what he wants. Direct translations are a major component of your grade and the only point when you actually need to come up with a original sentence is in the weekly compositions where errors matter far less than they do in the less of the grammar. Do not expect to learn French from this course, only grammar.

The course isn't too bad, but Professor Stark is. You just don't learn that much from him, and he even said in class, "You can't teach this stuff, it's pure memorization." He also makes a lot of sexual jokes, that just make you uncomfortable. You judge.

Prof Stark is an OK Prof. He runs thru the material very qucikly and it can get confusing....since this course was a 9S we would go over material for 3 days and have a test every friday.....as long as you review the material every night and pay close attention to the textbook you may do just fine
@

The course was alright - pretty easy and predictable. The drill instructor was great. The class was awful. Prof. Stark's lectures are boring and ineffective. When you ask a question about why something is happenning, he'll just mumble something about the second-person dative subject pronoun, which isn't very helpful to the majority of students. He can't explain grammar rules and just gives handouts on anything and everything. Apparently these are meant to help us understand things? Saying that, the course was easy to breeze through, but I don't think I learned anything

Stark is a funny guy. He teases students and adds humor to an early morning class, which is key. The course was basic language grammer and vocabulary. Nothing outstanding, but bearable for the language requirement. The weekly tests are fair, but you have to keep up to speed as Stark moves quickly each day.

Prof. Stark is an extremely knowledgeable and approachable professor, and is a great fit for French 2.  The only complaint lectures move too quickly.  The entire week's material would be presented on Monday, "reviewed" on wednesday and thursday, and then tested on Fridays.  I would have preferred to have had the material spread out more through the course of the week.
@
Samuel Stark
/course/1275
There was so much material to cover in this course, it made Prof Stark's job really tough.  There just was not enough class time for him to mention everything we needed to know.  So some important topics weren't really covered.  Weekly tests weren't that hard, but did require some studying.
@
Samuel Stark
/course/1275
French 2 is pretty basic, so it pretty much comes down to the prof and Stark is definitely one that you want.  He tells you what you need to know, in english when necessary, and jokes around a lot with the material.  American French profs are a lot easier to understand in French too.  He gives plenty of practice work, but you can do as much or as little as you want for yourself, he doesn't collect it.  Stark is a nice guy, and his work and tests are fair.

Julia's great.  She's enthusiastic about teaching Italian and very patient.  As a class, it's as interesting as any intro language class can be at that level.    It's relaxed and the tests are fair.  Not much work all around--except for drill.
@

/course/1275
Julia is an amazing professor! She adds her own creative touch to everything, which makes class more fun and interesting. For example, when we were learning about rooms in the house and furniture, she actually brought in a doll house. Little things like that really helped the concepts and vocabulary stick in your mind. She is also just a genuinely nice person. She's always willing to meet with you to explain things, even outside of office hours.  The homework is minimal - workbook/lab manual for each chapter, four short compositions, and random worksheets every once in a while. The quizzes aren't that difficult as long as you go to class (and drill) and study a little bit. As another reviewer mentioned, beware of the final! Even if you did well on the quizzes, the final will be harder than you think!  Overall, my experience with Italian at Dartmouth has been great! I'm really glad I started this language and I would recommend these courses to absolutely anyone.
@

I loved this class.  The Italian dept in general is amazing, and Julia is no different.  She made the material fun, and it was a very relaxed classroom atmosphere.  A little more work than Italian 1, but I thought it helped me learn the material better.  The final was harder than I expected, but if you study a lot, you'll be fine.  The other tests are all very appropriate to the material and not too difficult.  You have to do a composition every couple of chapters, and this took a fair amount of time, especially if you proof-read it a lot (which I recommend you do, to get a good grade), but it is worth it. Overall, it is a not difficult, fun, relaxed class.
@

We seemed to focus a lot on vocab instead of on grammar which is so much harder.  So some days we would spend all but ten minutes on vocabulary and then spend the last few minutes rushing through a really tough subject a rea.  It got to be frustrating sometimes.
@

/course/1275
Julia is a really good professor. She really makes all of the concepts clear and is always available to help anyone who is having trouble. She was also very organized and had power point presentation and worksheets. The worksheets were extremely helpful, so much so that I brought many of them with me on the LSA+.   The only problem is that she sometimes has problems with managing the time and class often ended five minutes late, which is a problem if you have another class on the opposite end of campus like I did.  Julia is awesome, though, and you should definitely take a class with her if you can.
@
Julia Viazmenski
/course/1275
THe course was excellent.  Despite Julia being born and raised in Vermont, you wouldn't know it from her knowledge of the language and her authentic accent.  Julia's lectures were great as she always had an interesting cultural aspect to supplement the new material.  Also, exercises in class were rarely from the book as most of the assignments were conceived entirely by her which made them much more interesting and fun to do.  Things to watch out for 1) Essays you'll lose points for lost of mistakes so proof-read over a couple of days  2) The FINAL This test is the first time you will ever see all the tenses put together into single exercises so study well, it's more difficult than the previous two-chapter quizes.
@
Julia Viazmenski
/course/1275
This course was about what you would expect from an intro language course.  The quizzes were pretty easy as long as you stayed on top of all of the grammar and the vocab.  I thought Julia was a great prof, but I know that other students in the class did not have the same opinion.  I, however, would recommend both the class and the prof.
@
Julia Viazmenski
/course/1275
There's not much you can do to dramatically improve how interesting an intro language class can be.  The only real help the Professor can give is by making it fun to come to class and helping explain all the details and quirks of the particular language in full.  Julia (as we were told to call her from day 1) did all of that, and also let us watch Pinocchio, which was awesome.  Drill can be either incredibly boring or fun enough depending on your instructor.
@

This class was perfectly paced, so although there's constantly new information that engages you, it's taught at a rate that you can absorb. Julia is a great prof and she really helps you understand the grammar of this language, which this course really focuses on.

Italian is the easiest language you can take at Dartmouth.  You'll get a good grade as long as you try, but interest and enjoyment is another thing.   Some profs in the department you'll love.  Viazmenski is not one.  You learn, true.  But every day is torture.  She is so sweet as a person and so lovable, but the most boring teacher you will ever encounter.

/course/1275
Nearly 10 hours of French per week is too much for almost anybody.  Between drill and class there is little reprieve.  While you will learn French (no doubt about that), you will learn it in a painful manner.    Tessier is a caustic and humorously scathing prof who doesn't hesitate to tell you when you're wrong, and makes an example of you for the class.  She is passionate about the subject, and in-class presentations force you to use and know the material, but Tessier's erratic lectures and unpredictable thought process leads to much confusion and frustration.

/course/1275
Tessier's FREN2 class is an easy way to get through the second part of the language requirement, especially if you have taken French before. She's a native speaker, so people who are used to American accents might have to get used to her real French accent, but it's well worth it. She focuses on grammar and the scenarios from the text, as well as some listening skills. Be sure you at least try to ask what is going to be on the tests, because she doesn't always tell you exactly. She stops checking blitz after about 4pm, so if you need some info for the next day, 1am is not the time to ask. Furthermore, she's adorable and tries to be funny as much as possible. Don't spill hot tea on her or on your classmates.

But besides that, if you have the opportunity to take this class with Beppe, you wont regret it.

This class was challenging and required spending at least an hour each night to work on the numerous homework assignments given each day.  The focus is overwhelmingly on grammar, which can get tedious and less than fascinating at times.  That being said, Fieke is really sweet (just make sure to do the hw she assigns, especially her review packets, which almost mirror the quizzes!)  You will dramatically improve your French speaking and comprehension skills by the end of the term, Fieke makes sure of that.  Our drill instructor was cool too.

Starting french at Dartmouth and not in high school puts one at somewhat of a disadvantage but the rate at which this class is taught really facilitates learning the language well, especially with the text.

Prof. Fabricant is a wonderful professor.  If you're looking for an easy way to get out of a language requirement, this is not the class for you.  Fabricant is sweet, really takes an interest in each student, and is an effective teacher.  She assigns a fair amount of work, and the class, I think, is more intensive than other French 2 classes.  The tests are very representative of the material, and are not too difficult.

Although Fabricant is known as being tougher than the other French 2 profs, she's by far the best!  If you really want to learn French take it with Fabricant.

She's really attentive to each person's progress and determined to make sure that each person succeeds.  I learned a phenomenal amount of French in this class, and she really helps to review old concepts as well.  Her tests aren't very hard and since she gives one every week studying for the final is super easy and not too time consuming.  It was a great class and I'm so glad that I had Fabricant!

French 2 is pretty straightforward- a typical intro language class. Prof. Burland wasn't bad, but she wasn't the best Prof either. No reason to avoid taking the class with her, but also no reason to schedule your classes to make sure that she's your prof.

Burland was not a good prof.  She seemed like she cared, but her lectures were not interesting, she was disorganized, and she really just didn't do a great job teaching the material.  I felt like there was no reason for participation to be manditory since all of the learning had to be done out of a textbook, which makes me angry because essentially I wasted $5,000 or so on this class.  It is pretty easy though, except for the midterms and final, which only account for 40% of the grade.  I did very poorly on them, but didn't bomb the class.  The biggest thing is that I was frustrated with the progress I made learning French, I chose to study it to learn the stupid languagge, and I think another professor could have helped advance my language skills a lot more.

Starting with the first class, Burland was not very reliable. I understand you have children and the like, but you are a professor and your students expect you to be there.  Overall, a poor French accent, ineffective lectures and rather unreliable, but a class that you could get through and do reasonably well if you do a little work.

There are two kinds of people who take this class people who took French 1 at Dartmouth, and people were placed into it by the school.  I'm latter, so I can't really speak for the former. If you  are confortable with the different tenses and moods, this class will pose no real challenge or problem.  It's still interesting because Professor Burland goes out of her way to make it that way. Also, I learned a lot of small things that I didn't know before.  I knew the subjunctive, but I didn't know how to use "lequel" or "dont", or "celui", and all these trickly little words. Drill is also amazing practice. For me, this was a great class to sharpen my skills that may have dulled since high school.

I really enjoyed this class a lot.  Madame Burland was very organized and made sure to split each class into a lesson component and then a practice component (i.e. handouts to practice grammatical changes).  She was very helpful in and out of class, and although she was not the quickest responder on blitz, she did always make sure to get back to you.  At the beginning of the class, she handed out a very organized syllabus that showed when x-hours were and detailed the subject of every lesson and the homework for every night, and she stuck to the syllabus almost exactly so you knew what to expect.  For homework each night, we would read the lessons in the book and then the next day Madame Burland would go over them and explain more subtle details about the material.  We had to write about 6 short essays, a page each over most weekends, but that was actually really easy and took an hour at most, often much less.  Only one big skit at the end, but that was a lot of fun.  The exams were extremely fair, she handed out practice midterms and finals that showed the exact structure of each test and the types of questions that would be on it.  For the final, she even gave us the essay questions ahead of time.  It was still a little difficult to remember some of the exceptions and everything, but there was honestly no excuse to do poorly on these tests, all you needed to do was study.  Mrs. Burland weighs attendance and class participation and homework very heavily, so it was a lot like a high school class.  I thought the class was easy but very effective and I would definitely recommend it.

Professor Mefoude really grows on you as a person and I actually really like her, but she is pretty disorganized. Some weeks we barely have any work, others we have stuff due everyday so it can get a little tough. Sometimes she doesn't tell us what we have to do in class and expects us to read over it on canvas, which I guess is fine but I'm used to a heads-up usually. That being said, in class she is great at explaining things and she teaches very well.
@
Sandra Mefoude Obiono
/course/1275
Mefoude was a total mess. She was an easy grader and nice, but outside of that she was kind of useless. She assigned tons of homework that was unnecessary (and often repeated itself) and did not communicate well at all. Didn't even need to attend class except for participation...notes did most of the teaching.

I went into French 2 my Freshman Fall after not doing anything involving French since my sophomore year of high school. To compensate, I worked with a tutor, conversation partner and Professor Mefoude outside of class. She is more focused on improvement than perfection, which I appreciated. And French was much more of a time commitment than I anticipated with the drills, use of all x hours and slew of homework. Professor Mefoude is very sweet and willing to meet outside of her office hours if you talk with her about a schedule conflict.

@

/course/1275
Mefoude is pretty disorganized but tries to be an encouraging teacher. The subject material was not difficult but I found that the textbook and posted powerpoints were more helpful than the class itself. Assigned a LOT of busywork. I would say the most useful part of going to class/drill was speaking practice. Grading is not harsh at all but between the use of all x hours and 4x per week drill and homework it's a significant time commitment so do not take this class if you're looking for a layup.

Overall the course was a good refresher on the french grammar I learned in high school. Professor Marcellesi is a very nice person and wants her students to do well.

Brown is great! However, I wouldn't say the class is a lay up. The test can be hard and she doesn't curve.

Madame Brown is extremely organized, willing to work with students, and reasonable with grading. Challenging but by no means an impossible class if you put in the work. Best French teacher I've ever had.

Katherine Brown
/course/1275
The reviewer who said Brown is "extremely organized" is out of their mind, and I like Brown. You will need to keep your shit together for this course, and if Brown hasn't changed how she organizes things by the time you read this review, that means checking very thoroughly in like 3 different places on Canvas and then also with your classmates for where the assignments are. I missed a ton of assignments without realizing they ever existed. With that said, it's a pretty good french course, and Brown is really nice. She knows that she isn't organized and will let you make up work with full credit if you just shoot her an email (or even if you don't shoot her an email). She's for the most part very reasonable with her tests and grades and general workload, and you should get an A if you put in the work. Wouldn't call it a layup, though. Also the French department (Michaela!!!!) is really really great, they plan a lot of events and things that are a ton of fun and get you speaking the language and if you go to them Brown gives you extra credit. I'd definitely recommend the class, it's quite good even through Brown's disorganization.

Conley was a good prof in that she knew what she was doing. However, there were times when the classes felt really erratic.

She was kinda fun, but also strict. Drill was annoying, but it's drill.

The class is interesting. At first I was planning on taking it just to get my language out of the way, but now I am strongly considering doinf an LSA. Professor Beasley is great! The tests may be hard but she does a great curve. Very inetersting teaches you a lot. I can easily say I am more comfortable with my french. She is very interactive with the students and adjusts the class to the enviornment in which we learn the best.
@
Faith Beasley
/course/1275
Prof. Beasley is an excellent professor, and if you have to take French 2 for your language requirement, she's a good choice. She is very challenging and fast-paced (this was her first year teaching French 2 in 15 years, she usually sticks to upper-level courses). However, she makes sure you get a strong French backbone, which is essential for French 3, and any other French courses you end up taking. While this course is not a breeze, it will end up making you better at French in the long run.

/course/1275
This class was your typical low level language class.  I took French in high school, but I really knew very little, and this class was not bad at all.  It is a ton of grammar, but Professor Renault makes it very manageable.  There is a quiz every Friday, and workbook assignments every week, but the work takes up very little time, and if you study by reviewing the awesome worksheets/charts professor Renault gives, they are not bad at all.  There are no midterms, and there is a final which isn't bad.   I really liked Professor Renault, I think it was her first time teaching here but she did a great job.  The handouts she gave us were much better at explaining grammar concepts than the book.  She is so nice and helpful, and really cares about the students.  If you have a problem or question about anything, she will be more than willing to help.

Nancy's a pretty good prof, her teaching methods are effective, and she's very understanding if you have problems during the class. That being said, she's not that exciting.  I had Emmanuel Rota for Ital 1, and he's awesome.  If there's a choice between them, get Manuel. She sometimes gets frustrated with the students who aren't as good at Italian, and seems to pick favorites (actually... more un-favorites) in class.  She liked me though, so no complaints, but it's important to make a good first impression.  She's nice, but behind that she takes things pretty seriously. She likes it if you're enthusiastic about the stuff we do in class, like the movies we watch, etc. Also, don't speak in English ever in front of her, she gets really annoyed.  ps--My friend had her for the LSA, and absolutely hated her.  I wasn't in as close contact with her, but I could see her not being that cool.

@
Nancy Canepa
/course/1275
I found this class to be of mixed benefits.  Professor Canepa is kind and understanding in classes.  Its unfortuate that the entire class is tailored for those who are going on the LSA.  If you're not. . .well buckle your seatbelt, its going to be a VERY long term.  The single most frustrating and annoying thing about this class is the assumption that you absolutely LOVE italian.  Besides the workbook and labbooks, which while certainly useful, are about as much fun as poking hot needles through your eyes, repeatedly, and drill, Prof Canepa requires you attend Italian table three times a term AT LEAST, as if one didn't have a lot of other things to be doing. . .like a social life.  Then there's the two movies that you are required to watch for 2.5 hours, only to spend about a half hour "discussing" in class. This consists mostly of the class vainly attempting to understand what Prof. Canepa is asking, since they were barely able to understand the movies themselves.  Then there's Skit Night, a required little show put on by the drill groups for the "fun" of everyone else on some random week night.  While I am sure that some enjoy this little soiree, making it a mandatory experience seems a little excessive to me.  On top of this are the compositions and homeworks, both which would appear to be useful, if only they weren't piled on top of each other like layers on a cake.  I must admit that the homework was helpful in understanding the language, but after 9 weeks, I was so burnt out, it became hard to muster the desire to do ANYTHING about it.  The compositions are good, but would be much more useful if the one got more than half a letter grade for resubmitting them.      Finally, the exams were decent, except for the final which was absurdly long and painful.  If any one thing about this course needs to be fixed, I would earnestly suggest that the class be given the whole period, insetead of frantically trying to squeeze it into the last 30 minutes of the class.

the professor did not teach. our classes consisted of ramblings about irrelevant topics and watching youtube videos of french pop music that barely demonstrated the grammar rules we were learning. our class was not prepared for the final's structure at all. the other french 2 class was much more prepared.

Prof Delogu is a nice man, but a horrible professor. He did not teach us any of the material we were supposed to learn, so we basically had to teach ourselves. The exams were even worse, because they did not reflect the chapter that we were supposed to learn for that week. Also, a lot of his policies were completely unfair, such as absences and missed quizzes. This man was clueless.
@

Delogu is really cool, but he doesn't really teach you any french, which was actually fine because it was easy to study the chapter before our weekly test and learn everything that way, but if you're looking for more guidance in the classroom, he may not be your man. He does make class interesting though...we you tubed french songs and whacky stuff a fair amount.

Prof Fodor tested "French Swearing" on the final (including "go f--- yourself"), played French chansons at the end of nearly every class, sang along to the oftentimes obscene lyrics, and taught the boys in the class how to tie cravates. He is always smiling, and I laughed through every lecture. His enthusiasm was infectious.   However, I did feel a little uncomfortable speaking in class because I felt like he was rushing me to speak faster than I could. The workbooks are busywork, and you really must know the material for the exams, which were usually straight English to French translation, every week.   I enjoyed Prof. Fodor's performance.
@

Professor Fodor's mixture of humor, useful conversational vocabulary and cultural insights made this class fantastic.  Without question, he made the course an overwhelming success.

I have mixed feelings about this class. The work was difficult and some of the readings were beyond my capabilities. I wish we'd studied grammar a bit more. But on the other hand, we were able to delve into French culture and read works of literature, Asterix comics, and sing along to Carmen in class.   Professor Fodor was very interesting and put on a genuine performance for the class every day. However, his singing and dancing about the room could be a bit much to handle if you were struggling to understand what he was saying, which was a lot of the time. He put students on the spot, which didn't really help us to learn French, it just made us feel a bit stupid.  Take this class, but be sure to refresh your memory by studying your French 2 material before you do.

Andrea Tarnowski
/course/1275
French 2 is a necessary course, and I learned a great deal of grammar. Drill is well intended, but students commented that they knew how to conjugate verbs, and repeat sentences orally, but had very poor conversational skills in French. 	Prof. Tarnowski was extremely condescending when students asked questions in class.  She was also very presumptive of people.  I felt like her goal was to make sure we could memorize 20 line dialogues for the exams.  I wanted to learn more French vocabulary/grammar but spent the bulk of my time memorizing lines, which tought me nothing except how to memorize.  Honestly, I wish I had changed professors for this course, which on its own seems to be decent.
@
Andrea Tarnowski
/course/1275
French two was a pretty basic low level class.  There was very little work outside of class, but, of course, you have to sit through drill.  I enjoyed the class and felt that I learned a lot, although I think most of the other students did not like Ms. Tarnowski's methods.  Also, I must add that I am a Romance Language major.  Her tests were not hard, but they involved a lot of pure memorization.  She also will assign three short compositions, but she grades them leniently.  If you solely are taking this course to furfill the language requirement, you may want to take it with another prof.  I, however, felt like it was what I wanted it to be.

You go through a lot more conjugations in Italian 2, and sometimes it's easy to mix them up. Giampiero has not taught Italian as long as some of the other profs and it shows.

Giampiero wasn't the most experienced prof, having never taught Italian before.

But, he is a sweet, well-intentioned guy and overall did a competent job.  I'm sure that the more he teaches, the better he will get.  Coursewise, this class is just what you'd expect of an intermedite language class, nothing more, nothing less.  The material isnt particularly exciting, but you will learn a lot.

To begin with, Loic is absolutely fantastic. Although he is new at Dartmouth, he cares deeply about his students and is super personable and funny. His class is engaging and he keeps the mood light. His teaching style is superb and, although he almost exclusively uses French, it's not difficult to understand and keep up. On the other hand, French II as a class is a marked increase of work from French I. The pace is rather quick and the variety of assessments (quizzes, tests, writing, presentations, etc.) is wide and there's always something new due. The upside is that I feel that I am learning an incredible amount of French in such a short term. All in all an excellent class that I highly recommend taking, especially with Loic.

This class really lives up to its name as it covers the entire spectrum of the American Political System, though not in any great detail. It's a terribly easy course and the workload is minimal. You write three simple three page papers and don't even have to do the readings, since he covers everything in class. It's an interesting class and gives you a very good background in the subject, not to mention a good grade if you're conscious for most of the classes. Professor Shaiko is great but a little hard to talk to during office hours.

Overall I liked this class.  For anyone who has taken AP American Gov't, a lot of the material will be familiar.

The prof's lectures are usually pretty good, though sometimes it seems like he goes off on tangents and I'm not sure how it relates to the topic at hand. The paper assignments I found quite easy, and the exams weren't too bad.  If you have any interest in govt and politics, this is a good class to take.

I'll be honest this was a distributive course for me. It was pretty interesting and having the class during the election made it more interesting. There is a fair amount of reading, but it's not necessary to understand the lecture, just necessary for parts of the tests which are pretty easy. His grading is bit subjective, but it has to be when there are essays involved and over 100 people in the class.

Readings were pretty interesting, but tests did not cover nearly all of the assigned reading.  Papers were graded easily, but tests were graded somewhat harder.

He was responsive to students, though, and overall the class was pretty good.

Shaiko tends to lecture straight out of the book; if you have any background in government you'll just hear the same things over and over again.

This was your basic introductory American government course.  Professor Shaiko gives very effective lectures, presenting the material in a way that is interesting and informative.  At times the material was just plain facts (ie the Constitution), but he managed to infuse it with personal experience in politics. Watch out he'll try to convince you to be a lobbyist ) It was also great to take this course during the Presidential Election, as we were able to tie in current events to the subject matter being discussed.    In terms of reading, its not too much, and all you really need to read is the Patterson book.  His exams are based solely on Patterson and some things from his lectures.  Aside from a midterm and final exam, you have to write 3 short papers (3 pages each).    If you have any govy interest--take the course.  It's a good way to balance a more challenging courseload.

prof shaiko is refreshing in the capitol hill experience he gives to the classroom, but is otherwise dry.  his lectures are sometimes very abstract and runny, but interesting nonetheless, if you are in to that sort of thing

I went into this class expecting to learn about American government and that is exactly what I left with - a better understanding of the American Political System. American Politics isn't a tremendously stimulating subject and that was reflected in the class. Overall Shaiko was good. My only qualm with him is his unavailability outside of class. After the class, I am not particularly interested in taking many more American government classes.

Professor Shaiko is a good lecturer; he is extremely knowledgable about the subject matter and often fills his lectures with stories about his own experiences on capital hill. He seemd rather unapproachable, but I was told that he was quite nice during office hours.  The reading was pretty basic; you only needed to read the Patterson text to pass the class (most of the exam questions were based on this book). The essays were fun and easy to write since they were based on your personal experiences. The test was harder, but if you study and attend class, you should be fine.

this was a good class-Shaiko is a good teacher. The most important readings are from Patterson. You could read only Patterson and do well on the papers and tests. There are also online quizzes, flashcards, chapter summaries, and outlines that are very helpful to study for the exams. There are three papers to write, and they are very basic.

I had to take this course as a govy major.  Shaiko is a very knowledgable and experienced guy.  Unfortunately, his lectures are totally disorganized.  Half the time you have no idea what he's trying to say and he often goes on long tangents about his work experience or some irrelevent examples.  The readings were good, though.

This course wasn't the most exciting in the world, but I did learn useful material that hadn't understood before despite a lifelong interest in politics and fairly good attention to current events. Professor Shaiko is very knowledgeable and smart, & does a pretty good job with lectures... I wish the class were smarter & had more opportunity for discussion, but with over 100 kids per classroom, he does the best he can. The midterms and finals play too big a part in the grades, in my opinion, & it's hard to study for them. He wants certain specifics on the short-answers, and if you don't give that, you'll get a bad grade. THe papers are pretty easy, by and large, and doing them early and talking to him really helps.

The course   Thousands of pages of relatively interesting readings.  Only the Patterson text is really necessary for tests, but the others help with background and specifics.  The exams are moderately difficult, and revolve mostly around short-essay answers.  The papers (3) are only 3 pages, and are graded pretty easily.  The Prof  Professor Shaiko is a good, interesting lecturer.  Although the lectures are occasionally off the main topics of the course, they are pretty informative.  Class is pretty optional, but will definitely help you on exams.  In general, a very good prof.

This course was very basic and minimal work - if you're very interested in government, you'll probably be bored.  For me - as a non-major who has never taken a govy course before - this class was a nice introduction to American politics.  Prof. Shaiko was a great professor who was always responsive to questions.  The lectures were interesting at times, though some of the material was dry.  Overall it was a fine course.

This class was interesting, but I was hoping for more on the election - it being an election term and all.  Te course gives you a good base/understanding of the American Govt system - so if you don't know anything, I would take this course...it's good into to know.  Professor Shaiko is very knowledgable, but his lectures are so packed full of info that he makes them hard to follow.  The exams aren't too difficult, but he doesn't give you a lot of time to finish the mid-term.  The homework papers are easy to write and for the most part he grades them rather easy.

I had a lot of expectations for this class. During the Gov open house, Chaiko really impressed me with the description of the class and mentioned, it being an election year and all, some of the current events would be discussed and analyzed. Problem is, this is hard enough to do in a class of 100, let alone when Chaiko changes the cap limit to about 140.   Discussion and participation were non-existent. Hell, I really only attended class about once a week. There are two exams and three papers. That's it. It's a very light workload.  The thing is, I took this class 3 years ago when it was called AP Government, so there was little new to learn. However, even though Chaiko needs a bit more practice lecturing, one should attend class to keep up. And even though there are no tests or quizzes or even papers, really, on the readings, one should do them regardless. It does help in the with the exams. But also, if you want to put it all off until reading period [or if earlier, two days before the mid-term], it's completely doable if you possess the discipline.  Not to be too hard on Chaiko, this is the only class I've ever had with him. I don't think lecturing is his forte, but I have heard that he's excellent one on one and in the smaller advanced seminars and on the FSPs.

Professor Shaiko does not exactly bring the subject to life, especially in a gigantic class of 125 students.  However, the readings were well-chosen and straightforward, the subject was broad that the Professor could choose the more interesting topics, and the examinations followed closely what we had learned.  As a result, this served as a fine intro class and a solid class to take.

Prof Shaiko is very knowledgeable about the way government works.  He had some very interesting lectures and some very boring ones.

Gov 3 with Professor Shaiko was a good class to take my first term in college.  It is more than just a high school intro government course, but not TOO much more, so it was a nice transition.    I would also recommend this course to upperclassmen who are interested in the policy and mechanical side of our government but do not want to brave an upper level gov course.  Shaiko is clearly very knowledgeable and experienced in the subject matter (he enjoys pointing out how he used to work "on the hill").  However, his lecture-style is not that exciting, so it is sometimes difficult to pay attention throughout an entire class.  The tests are based ENTIRELY, 100% on class lectures and the Patterson text book.  The essays are mostly opinionated and not even worth mentioning - they are EASY.  One could, theoretically, get a good grade and not ever pick up the other four required readings, as long as such a person attended most/all classes.  Shaiko would definitely be better in a smaller environment, at least it seems that way.

The lectures were interesting, albeit sometimes it gets warm and you doze off. If you actually did all the readings, you would have tons to do, but you don't really have to read everything.

This class is a typical intro government course.  The class was large - notes were cursory - lectures and readings were basic.  The grade was compromised of a midterm and final (accounting for about 70 percent of the grade) and three essays (each 10 percent).  He's a really easy grader and if you study for the midterm and final well, you'll do fine.  Most of the information is found directly in the Paterson reading.    However, his lectures are really bad.  He's a nice guy and well informed, he's just very poorly organized.  His notes are all over the place and he goes on tangents that sometimes have nothing to do with the topic at hand.  I had to take the class though.  If I were you, I'd take the class, preferably with a different prof.  But if you have to take an intro gov't course, take this one.  I guess...

This course was definately an introductory course but interesting at the same time. Professor Shaiko gives very effective lectures, intergrating current events into the basic terms and government institutions that you read about. His experience in politics and the national government is evident. The reading isn't too bad and there are only 3 short papers (3 pages each) and a midterm and final exam. If you are interested in government or need the course for a major/minor, I would recommend taking it with Shaiko, you won't be bored or overworked.

This course was really interesting. I learned a lot about the American political system. The readings were also really interesting. The main text by Patterson, was easy to read and was all you really needed to read in order to do well on the test. The other readings were really just for fun. They were also intersting, but not necessary.   Shaiko organized the course well. His exams were really FAIR assesments of hte course. And as long as you read Patterson and pay attention in class, mainly to understand how shaiko ties everything together, you will do fine on the exams.   The three 750 word writing assingements are really easy and match the material presented in the course.   Overall this was an excellent course. Shaiko is a boring lecturer, but his class does not require that much work and his exams are really fair.

This was a solid intro course. It was pretty easy. Just make sure that you keep up with the reading because it can really pile up if you procrastinate. The tests were straightforward, mostly from the Patterson textbook and from the review sessions that Prof Shaiko has before each test. The essays were basic and simple. The lectures didn't introduce any new material. I would recommend taking this course.

A very good, useful course to take.  Not having government in high school, it was very helpful for me to take a class on american politics for both citizenship and distributive reasons.  Shaiko is an extremely effective lecturer, very poised and always well-organized.  His experience working for a congressman helps him seem like he really knows what he's talking about.  The readings were sometimes long and a bit boring, but essential to knowing enough for the exams and papers, which were not too difficult and very fairly graded.  I highly recommend this course with this prof for people both considering government as a major/minor and those wanting to just know more about american government and how it works.

The subject matter of American Politics does not lend itself to a particularly engaging course... the Prof basically has to cover certain institutions, theories, and issues.  That said, Shaiko ably communicated the material that students should know after taking an introductory American politics course.  His lectures sometimes had a tendency to lull people to sleep, but he managed to repeat the important material enough times that people (hopefully) learned it.  The papers were ridiculously easy, but the tests were a little more difficult.  Pretty much all of the test questions came from one book, and the other books were supplementary.  If you read a newspaper on a regular basis and have taken an American history course, you already know 90% of the material in this course--don't waste your time.  If you don't read a newspaper regularly or come from a country other than the US, this is a pretty good--if necessarily shallow--introduction to the American political system.

Overall, I learned so much from the class. Professor Shaiko related the class to the books, but also extended our knowledge beyond the readings.

The Patterson reading was helpful, as was the primary source material.

Interesting topics covered in this course. Clear, informative, manageable readings and the paper assignments were very straightforward (3 pages max, usually personal response-type). Prof. Shaiko is an excellent leacturer - very well versed in the subject matter.  Downside Shaiko is a very arbitrary grader on the papers and test essays. Granted, most essay and paper grading is very subjective and arbitrary -- but he doesnt put any marks on the papers (other than the letter grade) or explain why you got what you got. He provides no grounds for improvement on future papers.  This was frustrating...   Overall, tests were very fair. Lectures were informative, albeit sometimes boring. And the readings were numerous but completely manageable. Good intro course!

While the lectures were sometimes a bit disorganized, he really knows what he is talking about and talks about experiences in Washington without sounding all presumptuous.     Reading in the main textbook was pretty easy, but I wouldn't waste my time reading Choices or Waldman because they were useless.

This course was just like my high school government course but easier.  The subject matter is covered very broadly and the interesting specifics are missed.  I needed it for my major but am still glad I took it.  If you took American Government in High School prepare to be uninspired.  There are only 2 tests and they cover material pretty broadly.  The three papers are a piece of cake opinion papers and I kinda had fun writing them.  All in all not too stressful a class.  Shaiko is an interesting guy but an unorganized lecturer.  I often found myself thinking "what's the point".  The only book you really need to pay any attention to is the Patterson book.  If you read that you probably don't even have to go to class.

Richard Winters
/course/1449
Upon entering this course, I thought that it would an in-depth version of a typical AP United States Government class, but that was not the case.  Thankfully, it was assumed that students already had extensive background knowledge of United States government, which allowed the course to take a theoretical approach to examining United States politics.  This theoretical approach was strictly an empirical one with a narrow focus, solely exploring why participants in the political system act the way that they do, not on the benefits or downsides of particular features of the American political system.  This theme was conveyed through daily readings of old political science works, almost all of which implemented utilitarian and economical models to explain the entire political framework of the United States in terms of self-interested, rational strategic decision making. The course itself was not a particularly difficult one.  One single-page, single-spaced essay was due each week, which could be written on any one of a number of topics that Professor Winters selected.  Additionally, there were three exams, not one of which was cumulative, including the final exam.  Personally, I rarely read the readings more than a few days in advance of the three exams, but managed to effectively learn the material and completely destroy each of the tests.  Participation in class is optional; in fact, I rarely, if ever, participated, and I did just fine.  However, be aware about five of the students in the class dominated all of the discussion, asking pointless, unrelated questions under a thin guise of great verbiage, probably just to show off to the professor.  While this was at times very amusing and/or laughable, particularly when a few of them physically shook with anticipation of getting to make unnecessary comments praising President-elect Obama, it was often merely annoying. Professor Winters has a clear interest in what he teaches and is always ready to share his enthusiasm.  Although his writings on the board and his unusual short-hand abbreviations for different terms are hardly discernable, his amusing and infamous tangents manage to make up for them.  While Winters does have an observably left-leaning political stance, it does not unfairly impact those in the course with different views. Overall, The American Political System is a solid introductory course, but nothing to get too excited about.
@
Richard Winters
/course/1449
Prof. Winters has no structure in his lectures and bases the entire class on whatever he thinks is important in the New York Times that day. That's great, but the tests reflect the reading, nothing of what he says in the lectures! There is an incredible amount of reading and most is incredibly boring. Other than the few staple pieces of poli sci literature, Winters has just chosen readings that are way out of date and many that he never talks about and are not on the test. When he creates his tests, he tries to find the most obscure term and then even if you know it, he takes off points without any explanation. He was useless in office hours and a very strange grader. For grading papers, he just underlines random words and phrases and you get a grade with no justification. This can be good or bad because if you get an A on the first paper, then you pretty much get an A on every paper. Likewise with a B. Avoid taking this class and ask Winters to retire )

Although the readings were really great and quite enjoyable, it was quickly apparent that lectures were mostly unnecessary.  On each midterm, there was usually only one question that wasn't in the readings, and that question could usually be figured out.  Despite the lectures being poor, the readings were really enlightening, the professor was available and helpful, and the midterms/final were fair assessments of the readings.
@
Richard Winters
/course/1449
Overall the class was pretty easy. You do get a bunch of readings, which can get a bit difficult, and have to write one essay a week. As long as you keep up on the reading you should be able to do well on the 3 tests you get in the quarter. He also helps you out by narrowing down the list of what you are expected to know for each test. Class discussions are sometimes interesting but can many times be a bit boring if you are not a huge political junkie. Its probably important to go to class just to get the handouts which really help simplify some of the readings.
@
Richard Winters
/course/1449
His lectures were horrible, I attended every class and do not know if there was a day in which I left class with a better understanding of the material. Lectures were basically an opportunity for "political junkies" to say their BS without it being refuted. His exams were completely random. They usually involved about 12 short answers, many of which did not reflect basic understanding of the articles but rather arbitrary knowledge of random things mentioned in the articles. You also need to write a two-page essay every week. This isn't so bad, but he rarely passes any of the papers back graded.

This class was amazing; the material is fascinating, the readings include many important writings in modern american politics, the assessments are totally fair, and the essays are manageable and serve to effectively reinforce the readings.  On top of this, Winters is GREAT. He has a hilarious sense of humor and clearly is very passionate about his subject, a passion that makes the class exciting and is contagious. Winters also enjoys discussing political issues outside of class with his students, and his well-informed analyses are fascinating.   Basically, TAKE THIS CLASS!
@
Richard Winters
/course/1449
This class was painful in every sense. Winters was obviously interested in the material but he seemed to have no understanding of a lecture. He constantly allowed the class to become a series of (rarely enlightening) discussions without any direction, which made it difficult to sit through class, much less get anything out of it. While his tendency for tangents and discussion was exacerbated by the election season, it seems that it would have occurred anyway.   Furthermore, he required weekly two-page papers (well, one page single-spaced) on the reading and would only blitz out the questions for the papers 24 hours in advance. The questions weren't usually that hard but they required you to do the reading and having to write once a week was difficult.   I was interested in the material, enjoyed some readings, and occasionally found Winters entertaining but it didn't make up for the majority of the lack of real lectures and the weekly papers.
@
Richard Winters
/course/1449
This class was interesting and taught me a lot about american politics.  The weekly essays are annoying especially if you are taking two other time consuming classes, but the best way to combat this is to always write them on sunday night so they are done before the term even starts.  The midterms and final are fair and really short which is nice.  Take this class if you want to learn a lot about government, mainly through reading and somewhat through lecture.  That said I have the sense that if you are a typical american (white, strong belief in america etc) that Winters will give you more day of light and become more of a friend and less like a professor.

Just god awful. Absolutely worthless lectures. Rambles unintelligibly for 10 or 15 minutes at a time. Lets idiots wax poetic for way too long. Readings he assigns are classic and important, but he does little to explain them in class. Writes "abbreviations" on the board for things no one is familiar with. Extremely mercurial grader.

Although his lectures were not always helpful he is funny and helps you learn a lot about politics in general. His class was enjoyable and he is always available during office hours. Great Class if you have no prior government knowledge. Interesting and the Prof is very fair when if comes to giving you a grade.

I took the class thinking it was going to be about American politics. It definitely focused way too much on theory rather than practice. Also expects tons of readings per class. Exams are completely random. He'll pull out a couple of sentences from one of the many readings and expect you to know exactly what it is.

Winters is a nice prof and he grades pretty easily, but his lectures were all over the place. He usually talked himself in circles, and it's not much of a discussion class. There are a ton of readings, and an essay due each week.

Professor Winters definitely has a lot of interest in and knowledge about his subject material.  He's almost always able to respond to student questions or paper topics and generally "translates" his reading into understandable, practical lessons.  The downside is that he's often long-winded and can talk for the entire class without stopping for a question or anything.  Often, he stops for random tangents that are amusing, but irrelevant.    The worst part of the course is the workload.  It's not entirely that the readings are too boring, it's not entirely that there are too many readings.  It's the combination of the two.  Unless you're VERY interested in modern day American political philosophy, I'd recommend really considering this course before signing up.  Overall, a decent choice, though.

Contrary to some negative reviews about Professor Winters, I would like to say that he really is a great guy. He is a good professor, but not a great one. His exams were not always fair and there was a little bit of unexplained grading on the exams.  But overall, he did a sufficient job on explaining the curriculum.  Professor Winters is a committed and passionate scholar of American government and it shows. He doesn't always do the best job explaining things. He tends to use many big words and somewhat convoluted logic. However, his  rants and tangents are a part of the class and are not to be seen negatively.

The lectures were fairly interesting, as was the reading material.  However, the amount of reading is quite a decent amount (upwards of 100 pages the night before each lecture day).  If you are a diligent student, though, and can handle the 9S time slot, this is a good class.

Professor Winters is really nice and responsive to students, yet he inspires no interest in the subject.  The readings all revolve around the same thing and the exams are difficult. But I guess it's not too work and if you do the readings and know the material well, it's not very stressful.

I loved this class. I know that many people did not like the material that was covered, but it was very interesting. This class is very theory based which definitely give you a new way to think about American politics. Professor Winters is a great intellect. My one complaint is that his grading could be very slow. It took a while to get papers and exams back, but besides that, this is a great class if you are interested in American politics. If you aren't, I wouldn't take it because this is for real Gov lovers.

To be fair, Dick is a nice man - but that's about the only positive thing I can say about this class!   Dick is the "classic example" of a lazy tenured professor he gives rambling, semi-coherent lectures; he never refers to half the readings he assigns; much of his material is outdated (a book on the Republican Revolution?!); his comments on papers are illegible and (presumably) unhelpful  - you get the idea.   Most of the reading he assigns was annotated sometime in the 1970s and thus doesn't show up very well when you print it out. That's not really a big problem in itself; it's more of a metaphor for how lazy he is.  In order to show unconvincing "causal relationships," Dick draws incomprehensible flow charts with seemingly random abbreviations on the board. I stopped copying them after the first week of class, when I realized how worthless they actually were.  Many of the readings are filled with economic jargon, so it was helpful to have taken an economics course coming in. However, I'm not suggesting that you do that, because you shouldn't take this class at all!  Hands down, it was my worst course at Dartmouth.

The topic of this course is pretty interesting, but prof winters can be really confusing.  His notes are disorganized and his writing on the board makes no sense.  He has discussion sections that aren't discussion oriented at all...just an extra lecture.  He's a nice guy, and if you like the subject material, you can get past his weaknesses.   The worst part about it was that it was a 9s.

If you have taken government classes before, you'll have seen a good portion of the material in this class, but prof Winters picks readings that bring new perspectives and information. He's an entertaining lecturer. Tangents are plentiful and funny.  3 one hour tests and 5 two page papers = not that much work. The papers are graded very easily. The midterms are average.
@
Richard Winters
/course/1449
As a freshmen I thought this class would be a good intro class because I would just be refreshing myself on the concepts and ideas of American political system.  However, it was more than that, Winters asks his students to go beyond just the textbook and ideas and forces students to think theoretically about American Politics.  The reading load is manageable only if you are a skilled reader.  The lectures could be more focused, Winters prides himself on being the "Tangent King of Silsby Hall".  Otherwise Winters is good, he's always available when you need help. The problem is his information is not always relevant.  His grading system on his essays are pretty standard, however, his test grading system is confusing and leads to confusion about students grades in the class. In the end though I would take the class again.

I needed this course for the major, but after taking it I am very disappointed with it. I took it to learn more about the American Political system today, yet the majority of the lectures were irrelevant. The readings are quite boring and dense, and pertain to the 50s and 60s, only a handful were current. Prof. Winters is a really nice guy, but a horrible lecturer, I never knew when one point ended and the other began. Not a horrible course, but I'd stay away from it if you don't need it- at least till a different prof. teaches it.

this course is taught as a 9s, which makes the lectures shorter and more bearable. Prof Winters is an unusually fair grader and will usually buy what you have to say on papers if you can back it up. There's a lot of reading but he doesn't expect that you do it all; advice break up the readings with friends. As usual, the presentation is pretty professional, as the gov dept usually is. The final isn't cumulative, which means it's only over the last third of the course definitely clutch.
@

Prof. Winters is a nice and perfectly pleasant man, but his lectures reveal little outside of the readings. He constantly attempts to create strange mathematical formulas for various political activities, and submits to his classes Powerpoint presentations that, if he didn't go over in front of them, would be entirely incomprehensible. The multiple choice exams are full of trick questions, leading one to wonder whether they are attempts to educate or merely frustrate. I know people who never attended the classes who got better grades on the exams than those who attended every one.

I definitely had different expectations for this course after getting it out of the ORC... it has great potential to be really interesting, though, but it never quite got off the ground.  I had gov't in high school, so I had a good background for the subject - if you don't though, Winters isn't going to help you with that.  The class was based on readings of seemingly random political scientists' articles, and then you're tested on what each scientist had to say in that one article... felt like I was just memorizing one particular point of view, but not getting a comprehensive grasp on the topic.  Tests aren't too bad - just stay on top of the readings and you'll be fine -  also, no real need to go to class (supposedly mandatory) if you do the readings.  4 one page papers, 3 tests. no final.

Gov't 3 definitely contributed to my education.  I feel I learned so much from the course, although both the lectures and the readings became very confusing at times.  Many concepts appear numerous times, and became common knowledge in the class.   Prof. Winters makes this course what it is.  The blackboard is oftentimes covered with criss-crossing lines, illegible acronyms and abbreviations, and a four-section chart.  The class lends itself very easily to either liking or hating.  Personally I liked the course, but it bothered me that lectures sometimes didn't all make sense.

winters was an enjoyable prof.  his lectures were a little scattered and he heavily relied on powerpoints, but he was extremely likeable.   i felt that his tests were hard, but were very fair as far as following the material the weekly papers also weren't bad since they could only be one page long, but sometimes the questions were difficult to answer.   there was also alot to read in every section, and often the readings were difficult. but all in all, the class was okay and winters was great.

Dick Winters is what happens to professors after 40 years of teaching they get lost in the realm of theory. His lectures are sometimes a little hard to understand and he uses alot of technical jargon. He is a nice guy though and is well meaning. As the chair of the department, he definitely knows what he is talking about. Look on the bright side though, the tests are relatively easy and the essays are no big deal. The course material is interesting if you like government and the course seems to be a good primer for American political theory. You may hear bad things about this course but chances are they are from people who aren't interested in government in the first place. Take this course, you'll learn something and it could be a lot worse.

Professer Winters did an excellent job introducing students to many influential thinkers about the American political system.  Although difficult at times, the readings were reflective of major themes throughout the American System.  Professor Winters is very interested in student interpretations and perspectives of the political ideas, he was approachable and motivating.  Strongly suggest as an intro class to the government department.

Professor Winters accomplished everything he said he would, which wasn't much.  I have no complaints about the course or Professor Winters, but don't expect too much out of the course.

Professor Winters is a really, really nice guy. That said, he is a terrible, terrible professor.  His lectures are not intelligible. They ramble, they swerve, they go on all sorts of tangents. He actually has a system-he announces it to the class on the 1st day-he raises his left hand for a relevent tangent and his right hand for an irrelevant tangent. Or is it the other way around? All the lectures are irrelevant so we really can't tell.  The readings were obscure theorists that in some cases, had nothing to do with the American government. Mancur Olson's article on the British parliment and monarchy was dense, and it was never related to American gov.  In short, I cannot recommend this class. If you thought this would be the college equivilent of a civics type class, it's not. If you actually enjoy political theory, then take gov. 6, the prof. has to be better then Winters.

While the material itself was interesting, sometimes it was hard to tell what the overall goal of the coure was. The readings can be a bit confusing, but they are the major homework in the class, besides them there is hardly any homework at all. Overall an interesting class if you have a interest in the subject, but if you don't care about politics you probably won't enjoy this class.
@

while the readings are generally pretty interesting (although sometimes difficult to understand), the class itself wasn't so great. the tests pressure to memorize specific details about the articles instead of being able to apply them to real world situations. we very rarely looked at the american political system, focusing more on abstract theory without ever seeing if was useful or effective in real life. after taking another class with shaiko later, i feel that he would stress the actual function of the american government system much better and the class would be much more useful with him.

Take this course if you have a burning desire to learn about disputes between political scientists. There is some substance to this class, but most of what you will learn is the opinion of the article authors. The tests are arbitrary and so is Winter's grading.
@
Richard Winters
/course/1449
Although the course could have been interesting with another prof, Winters prevents it from being so.  The biggest problem is his propensity for deviating from the lectures into various tangents that serve as nothing but filler material, and his lecture style is extremely confusing.  Despite claims to be an "empiricist," all the class learned was Winters' personal views on politics, with very little in the way of hard, reliable facts that empiricism implies.  I felt that I learned very little about the American Political System, after which the course is named, and instead learned various theories about why politicians seem to do anything possible to get votes.  The true-false tests poorly test knowledge and are often worded confusingly, although the short answer questions and the 4 weekly papers assigned were useful and graded fairly.  Overall, I'd recommend the course if a better prof were teaching it, but not with Winters, especially if this is your intro to the GOVT major; all of my friends who have taken this course with Winters agree, and tried to warn me in vain near the start of this term.  Don't make the same mistake I did.

The first few weeks I really didn't like the class- I didn't understand the readings and I felt the course content did not fit the course description in the ORC. I was expecting a sort of civics course but this course discussed more the methods that politicians use to make decisions.  Once I got used to the somewhat high volumes of readings, though, I really started to enjoy the class.  The readings were interesting and they definitely brought up issues I never would have even thought of on my own.    The lectures were only helpful if I had read the articles already and I was often behind in my reading.  The tests were somewhat easy and definitely covered the material fairly.

Professor Winters is extremely friendly, and willing to help anyone.  The True/False exams he gives are usually pretty hard even if you study a lot and read all the readings.  But he is very understanding, and wants people to do well.  Overall, this class has an average amount of work; at some point, you really must read all the readings because you will be tested on all of them.  But you don't ever have to go to class if you don't want to (and at nine in the morning, most days you don't want to go).  A good class.

Brooks is vain as no other, loves talking about her previous work, and forgets that she has a class outline to get through. Lectures are just powerpoints. She is BORING.  The midterm covered material we had not quite gotten through because she was sick and decided to not make up class time. Grades seem assigned at random.   The readings are interested.

Good solid class. The material is a bit basic for anyone who's had any sort of coursework in government before, but Prof. Brooks does a good job of introducing relevant and interesting academic literature to the subject. She previously worked as a pollster for Gallup, and because of that, she has lots of hard data which contrasts some of the more theoretical aspects of the course. She is also very willing to help students outside of class.  I strongly recommend the course to anyone who hasn't taken an American Politics class before, though if you have, you may want to take a different intro Gov course.

Don't take GOVT 3 with Brooks. Wait until another term to take it with a better prof.  Brooks used to be a pollster and loves to talk about it. LOVES to talk about it. Her lectures are basically polls that, while sometimes interesting, shed little insight into the topic at hand. Readings are brought up once in a while and rarely debated and discussed. Her lectures ramble and it's difficult to understand the point. She hands out outlines on what she goes over for each topic and you look at them afterwards and wonder what the use of the outline is if she doesn't follow it.  The reading isn't too bad with some interesting articles mixed in.  If you want to actually learn something about American politics/actually enjoy the class, wait around for another prof. Not worth taking with Brooks.

Professor Brooks is unresponsive and irresponsible. Three of the first four classes were canceled (sickness, or something) and only one X-hour was used to fulfill the time missed. Mind you this was a 2A, so we effected missed 6 hours of lecture and recuperated only one hour. I blitzed her maybe seven times and never once received a reply. I kept a running tally--on the back of my class notebook--of the number of times she mentioned her time at Yale, her tenure at Gallup, or her political dissertations. Those were the only notes worth taking, as the only powerpoint slides she bothered projecting were charts and figures that had ZERO course relevance. Furthermore, her grading procedure is horrible. She doles out grades at random. Avoid. At. All. Costs.

I had never taken a comprehensive American civics course before so I found this information to be very useful and important to know. While the readings and material were often a bit dry, they sparked my interest in American politics and helped me read the newspaper with much greater understanding. It was pretty exciting to be able to relate what we learned in class to the current issues of the day, like the Alito hearings.   Brooks was overall a pretty good prof. She was really organized and was really enthusiastic about the material (especially about the role of public opinion in politics which she teaches another class about and mentions maybe a little too often). She really seemed to care about the class and we had a lot of speakers, including two former Congressmen and Nan Aaron, the head of alliance for justice, come in to speak with us.   However, there were some things about the class that bothered me a bit and made this feel kind of like a high school course at times. Our midterm quiz that was supposed to test how much of the reading we had taken in was way too specific and short to be an accurate representation of our knowledge. We also did a group project in which we had to create a 30-sec ad to convey an important political message to today's youth. While the project ended up being kind of fun, I feel like there was way too much time being spent on learning how to use imovie as opposed to learning about issues that young people should be concerned about. While I definitely had some complaints about specific assignments in the class, it was still a great class that made me more interested in taking future classes in American politics.

Unless you have never taken an American government class before, or you are from a different country... avoid this class!  This was a complete repeat of AP US gov for me... and it was less interesting this time around.  Repetitive, elementary, boring are all words that come to mind when describing this class.  Moreover, the activities that Prof Brooks has us do are middle-school level (i.e. create an advertisement)  Furthermore, her grading makes no sense... While I have a complete comperhension of the material, she uses random projects (like advertisements) and a reading quiz (with around 15 T/F) to calculate your grade...  I didn't learn a thing, I was bored out of my mind and it was a complete waste of time.  I'm really sorry that I took this course ... AVOID IT!

Even though I took AP gov in high school, I found this much more interesting.  Brooks went into more depth and clearly knew what she was talking about. The readings were all interesting and I lvoed the advertisement project.  Also, though occasionally students would just speak for the sake of participating, having class participation as part of the grade made classes much more lively.  I also loved how she knew everyones names and the guest lecturers (Nan Aron from the Alliance for Justice and two former congressmen) were fantastic.  One complaint the reading quiz was unrepresentative of the material and worth too much in the final grade. Overall though, very interesting and insightful.

If Government 3 was not required to become a Govy major, very few people would be taking the class. It is essentially the same introductory class that you were forced to take in High School, but in all likelihood taught less effectively.  Deb Brooks (who is married to Stephen Brooks, an up-and-coming International Politics professor) is knowledgeable about her expertise, polling and its role in elections, but lacking in most of the other subject areas. She teaches exclusively from Powerpoints, which either convey arbitrary information that you will not be tested on or reiterate the more obvious points in the textbook. Though a class of fifty people is small enough to learn through led discussions, Brooks opts instead to use Powerpoint, usually disengaging the class and leaving the majority wishing they had not bothered to attend. Her Powerpoints are never made available online, however, and the suspicion that she would sneak something novel from them onto a test (such as the Mid-term, which featured 13 arbitrary fill-in-the-blank questions)was the only thing that prompted students to continue to show up.   The paper (worth 30%) was on a topic distantly related to our readings and what we had been discussing in class, and was not graded in time for us to receive it before the Final. The Final essay was also on an extremely broad topic, one you would probably be able to sufficiently answer without having gone to class or even done most of the readings.  The readings were perhaps the biggest problem with the class. I took a class on the American Government again because I felt that I had learned little from my junior-high Civics class, and that at Dartmouth, I would be presented with a plethora of new, objective material that would allow me to formulate my own opinions on aspects of the government and on political topics relevant to the day. Instead, the material was, without exception, ultra-liberal; only one side was presented for every issue. I do not affiliate with one political party or the other, but I resented the biased material  that we were assigned to read daily. The 'textbook' was informative, but was interlaced with Democratic propoganda that added nothing to the text. The fact that the book was written by Samuel Jacobson, a huge proponent of the Democratic party, should have been clue enough. The O'Connor book is worth reading, and introduces the class to a variety of notable political science scholars and some of the most famous essays on the government ever written. The David E. Price Congress book must be purchased from an outside source (it is not sold on campus), and is not worth buying. The quantity of readings is manageable, but can get difficult, especially on Tuesdays, given the fact that Brooks assigns the same amount of work between Tues/Thurs as she does between her Thurs/Tues classes.  All in all, I did learn a variety of useful information from Gov 3 (mostly the textbook). I don't think that Brooks adds anything special to the class, but think that her 'Polling and Public Opinion' class could conceivably be interesting, given her knowledge on the subject and assuming that she does not teach that class exclusively from Powerpoint as well. The class, despite my complaints, was relatively easy, and the subject matter is generally pretty interesting. There are worse classes you could take at Dartmouth than Gov 3 (Vampires and Firebirds, anyone?), and probably worse Profs out there than D. Brooks. It's up to you.

Prof. Brooks does a good job of trying to make this not seem like a high scchool government class. However, we often got off-topic in lecture and discussion, and could have managed our class time much more effectively. Additionally, our grade consisted of a reading quiz, a video ad project, a paper, and a final. The paper topic was really stupid, and overall we weren't tested on the majority of the important concepts we learned except for a final ala format "tell me everything you know in two hours"

As if the winter wasn't horrible enough, I had to take this class.  I honestly don't know how many times I wished I could've shot myself right then and there, if not to put me out of my misery, then to at least make this class more interesting.   I have to say, I'm biased because I took AP Gov't but I got a four.  Thus, I had to sit through all this material that I already knew listening to Prof. Brooks go on and on about how she went to Yale and how she worked at Gallup. On top of that there were the regular government douches who never shut up. Take it if you need it, but don't take it with her.

For someone unfamiliar with how the American government ticks (esp. international students), there's a plethora of information to learn.  But for a govt major and/or someone fairly knowledgeable of current events, the class has trouble fulfilling its true potential.  The course appeals most to the least common denominator - those who know barely anything about the American government.  But for others (namely people who are born here), a good portion of the class is devoted to learning about how a bill becomes a law, the three branches of government, civil rights, civil liberties, etc.  Even for someone who never took AP Government, I found myself repeating a lot of what I had learned through social studies classes throughout high school.  The class shines the most when focusing on specific, relevant topics.  Getting a taste of Professor Deborah Brooks' passion, public opinion, entices many a student to want to take that mid-level course.  Getting to know more about Congress members on an individual level through a) an autobiography and b) two visiting ex-Congress members was truly an enlightening experience.  Producing 30-second ads, albeit time-consuming, is nevertheless an enjoyable experience that flexes your political consulting skills.  Her short-answer midterm is the trickiest part of the course.  Ample studying guarantees an appropriate grade that's relatively much higher than the class median/average.  The questions are specific, but never too nitpicky.  The answer that required a paragraph-long response was surprisingly simple.  It seems that the more we had to write in the assignments, the broader they got.  The paper asked us to argue for or against a particular topic, allowing us much leeway for responses.  The final was extremely disappointing.  It was easy, broad, poorly developed, requiring us to laundry-list our way to an appropriate response.  While naturally all three branches are covered, in the assignments, lectures, and readings, Professor Brooks showed a ridiculous bias towards the legislative branch.  I think it was rather fortunate since it's the branch that's often given the least exposure, and she did a good job teaching us about it.  It also helps if you ever plan to go intern for a Congress member.  When compared to the other government intros I've taken, I must say that this had the poorest quality.  If it were more in-depth, focused on more particular topics, and dropped the HS recaps, it would succeed more in enticing the students.  If you're looking for an easy government course, then this is by far takes the cake.  If you're looking for an interesting, worthwhile one, try another.  On a side note, I keep hearing Deborah Brook's intro is atrocious, while her Public Opinion course is amazing, so only take this course if you have to.  If you want a better Brooks course, go with Public Opinion.

The course wasn't too much work, just some readings, an in class essay midterm and essay final, and a 6 page (maximum) paper, topic given.  Lectures were ok - not incredibly interesting, but not really boring, at least not if you are interested in politics.  The beginning starts out a  little slow, talking more about the Constitution/Founding Fathers, but then the class picks up when you get to more modern, relevant topics, such as interest groups and lobbying.  I'm not a fan of the essay tests -you have one or two short answers, which require a very specific answer from a randomly selected reading or chapter from the textbook.  These can be a little rough because you can do a lot of prep, but happen to miss what she asks.  The longer essay (worth the bulk of the points) is much more general, however, and lets you draw in a lot of your knowledge from lecture/readings and show off what you have learned.  Overall, a good third course if you need one without a lot of work, and interesting if govy is your thing.

The class feels like a trip back to high school political science, mainly due to D. Brooks' lecture style and "participation grading".  This is not a very enjoyable class, and although it's not very difficult, it's not really worth a good grade.

This class was pretty dull, because it was mostly repeated info.  If you are already up on current events, it is basically a review.  It is a good third class if you need a break.  Her lectures are not great, but she does a pretty good job with a pretty dry, basic topic.  She loves the topic, and that helps too.  If you are ignorant of the political system, though, I think it would be much more interesting.  She does one midterm, one final, and one paper.  The paper and the majority percentage on both exams are very general, completely encompassing questions.  But I must admit on the final she threw a very specific key term from the textbook in a chapter I did not read as a question and it COMPLETELY fucked up my grade.  Until then, I had maintained an A, but it is my fault really because I spent a very minimal time studying.  But again, it is a waste of a class if you keep tabs on current events and know about the branches of government, not the professors fault because I guess that is info that needs to be taught in an intro course.

THe class is interesting and was in general easy to understand, follow, and process all that is thrown at you.   However the class becomes overly stressful for 3 main reasons  1. grading anything takes ONE FULL MONTH - we only got to see feedback from our first midterm on teh day before the drop date  2. Midterms and Finals are so unrepresentative of all the material that you've studie its unfair. FOr the FInal I studied with great detail several chapters in the textbook and notes that amounted to a couple hundred pages. And the final only had three questions, 2 of which were only explained in a single paragraph in teh book and the third was from an obscure reading that we never talked about and no one read!!  3. Professor Brooks wil always say before an assignment that she is not going to answer any questions other than clarifying questions just to make things fair... and then when you go in to ask her a reasonable quesition she says that 'figuring it out for yourself is part of the assignment"   In conclusion, she is very knowledgeable and her class is informative, but the tests and asignments are not representative of all the info youve taken in, and I dont think she is very concerned about students succeeding in the class...

If you are interested in politics at all but don't know a whole lot about it, you should definitely take this course.  I learned a lot and now understand much more about the political process.  The only thing that might be a drawback about the course is that your grade isn't based around a whole lot.  There was a paper, a final exam, and around 5 short quizzes.  By the end of the class over 60% of my grade was still up in the air.  Participation is a big part of the grade in the class, so if you are uncomfortable with having to speak out during class, you might not want to take this class.

Really easy class and very little work. Prof Brooks wanted lots of participation but was not always the most approachable professor in the department. Brooks often talked to the class like we were in 6th grade and assigned a paper that she later graded with a rubric of bullet points that had to be discussed in the paper for a good grade. She also did not bother to return the paper before the end of the trimester so no one would know how they stood in the class at the end.

The problem with this class is that if you've taken AP Government or any other American Govt class at Dartmouth already, this is complete review if you take it with Brooks.  She says she'll try and teach "barbarics" or incorporate actual theory instead of listing the duties of each branch.  But the quizzes and tests ask you to do just that, and there are only a handful of academic papers.  If you're an upperclassman with experience in Government and you have to take this class don't do it with Brooks or you'll be very bored.
@
Deborah Brooks

If you've ever taken a high school civics/government/history course, you'll cruise through this course with little difficulty. The course is a general overview of American politics, and it's a lot of common knowledge that's formalized into a class.  Professor Brooks doesn't do a great job with this class, but it's not her fault - the material is dry and difficult to engage students. You don't really get into enough depth to really enjoy the class.  I'd highly recommend taking Professor Brooks' Public Opinion (Gov 37) class. She's fabulous in there - it's her specialty - and a wonderfully engaging prof.  If you have to take this class, keep up on the readings - her quizzes are nitpicky and harder than they seem; they're based almost entirely on little details in the reading.

This is a good class to take for anyone who wants to learn the basics of American politics. If you have taken it in high school, it will probably mainly be review, but if you haven't it is good information to know. Prof Brooks is friendly and her lectures are interesting. She also does in class activities to break up the monotony of lecture.
@
Deborah Brooks
/course/1449
I'm not sure whether it's the class or the prof, but I didn't learn much in this class at all. I am an international student with very little background in either American history or politics, yet even I felt that I learned almost nothing that was new.  Prof Brooks spends much too much time in class discussing material without actually teaching. And due to the rather large percentage of the grade given for class participation, students tended to raise useless and unneccesary points.  All in all, it was a boring class and a waste of time and money. The only reason for which you should take this class is to satisfy distribs.

If you had an American government course in high school, you have no reason to take this course. Professor Brooks is uninspiring. Her lectures are trite and rely too heavily on PowerPoint. Avoid this course and professor if you possibly can, unless you enjoy wasting credits.

The professor is mean and boring.  It was a horrible experience.  Itâ€™s like a high school civics class only boring.  I went into office hours, I wish I hadnâ€™t, she is the type that doesn't want to help her students.  Sheâ€™s the type that will say, â€œIts not fair to the other students if we talk about your paper topicâ€.  She wouldn't talk about anything academically related in office hours for that reason.  She made me feel like a cheat for asking questions.  Iâ€™ve never had a professor be like that and I go to a lot of office hours and ask a lot of questions.  I guess take the class if you are looking for something easy, but I hated it regardless.
@
Deborah Brooks
/course/1449
I was actually really interested in the material, but the fact that of the 2 hours spent in class, more than half of it was spent "discussing" the material.  brooks style of teaching resembles that of a junior high school teacher, in that she likes having her students work in groups and engaging in unnecesarily long discussions that usually involve certain students repeating the same points over and over again.  her "lectures" were mostly taken right from the book and put on a powerpoint presentation.  if it weren't for the 15% class participation grade, i would have never gone to class.
@
Deborah Brooks
/course/1449
The course did not have the focus on law that I expected it to. A great deal of focus was placed on public opinion, which I felt detracted from the course. However, it is a good general introduction to the American Political System, even thought the reading is very dry at times.

This class is exactly the same as the Political Science class you took in HS.  It's boring, the prof is boring.  She never got out from behind her damn powerpoint presentation.  but, it's an easy way to work on your govt major or minor.  my advice take the class from Prof. Shaiko if at all possible.

Its a difficult class to judge, because I took American Govy in HS. I found this class to be too slow paced and not cover material in depth. The professor was also not terrific- she's new, give her time. Otherwise, the course was good because it did keep me really involved in American politics.
@
Deborah Brooks
/course/1449
The class overall was a satisfactory intro class, with a nice approach based on public opinion (Brooks background and specialty).  She is very nice, almost too nice, allowing discussion to go on for too long sometimes.  Class exercises were fun, a good break, though sometimes pointless.  I thought she allowed too many partisan and/or irrational comments into the discussion (not only that but she acted as though they added to the quality and depth of the discussion!), but I guess that's common in Gov classes.  People got worked up about stuff too often (a liberal slant definitely, but not exclusively), and spouted misinformed opinions.  If you took a good gov. class in high school, this should be an easy rehash (just a little rational choice theory thrown into the mix).  Definitely worth it for the small class size though, especially for freshmen.
@
Deborah Brooks
/course/1449
Brooks was ok, all the non-govy majors that took the course and never took government in high school loved the course.  For me and the rest of the people in the class that really liked government as a subject and were potential majors the course was kind of a bore.
@
Deborah Brooks
/course/1449
Brooks' section was capped at 35.  This was awesome, because it meant that in an intro class for one of the most popular majors, the prof. knew everyone's name.  Discussion was a major part of the class, though that was a blessing and a curse.  Some people had informed opinions, others knew class participation was worth 25% of their grade.  Sometimes we covered the assigned readings, sometimes we didn't.  All in all, it was an interesting class-inspiring too-and I'd recommend it strongly because of its' size.
@
Deborah Brooks
/course/1449
...as hell. I don't know, it having been 3 1/2 years since, if it was the professor's lecture style or the subject material, but I suspect it was a combination; if I can still remember her speech patterns even now, without ever seeing her again, it's a bad sign. The material was singularly uninspiring, but what can one do with introductory civics (or the equivalent thereof)? I suspect that with a different lecture style or lecturer, this could be survived. I know I fought to stay awake the *entire term*, and it was a mid-afternoon course! I may be being too harsh on the professor - like I said, I've never taken her other classes, and frankly I was afraid to do so. One of my only anti-recommendations here.
@
Deborah Brooks

American politics is something i'm very interested in, and prof. brooks managed to make class a chore, even painful. she graded a lot on class participation, but it was not group discussions, just regurgitating what she wanted to hear. i didn't feel that i learned very much from the course.

Dean Lacy
/course/1449
Prof. Lacy is awesome! I took AP gov in high school and thought it would be a fairly similar class, however much of the class was about the development of political theory rather than the US Government. Professor Lacy always has super interesting lectures and has great guest speakers such as Mitt Romney's campaign manager Stuart Stevens and senator Judd Greg. The tests were mostly based on a pretty heavy reading load, but the course material shifts to more practical rather than theoretical concepts in the second half of the term. If you are willing to go to class, do the reading and take detailed notes on EVERYTHING he says, this shouldn't be too difficult of a class. I would definitely recommend this class to the typical Dartmouth student and plan on taking a few more of Prof. Lacy's classes in the future.

TAKE THIS CLASS WITH DEAN LACY IF YOU POSSIBLY CAN. I still say its one of the best classes I've taken at Dartmouth and often say he was one of the best professors. It was heavily lecture-style but he kept it super entertaining and interesting in spite of that. He has a miraculous talent for going on 20 minute fun story tangents and not relating it back to the topic at all, and then two hours later you realize you actually now understand the topic. Insanely cool guy who brought amazing people to campus and was cited in most articles we read. Super easy open-note exams which was amazing of him to do because it really allowed us to learn the material out of interest more than because of stress for our grades. He's pretty intimidating but I highly, highly recommend you make the effort to take him to a meal, etc and get to know him because he appreciated it so much and goes out of his way to say hi to me ever since and remembered my name a year later. TAKE THIS CLASS AND PROF!!

@

/course/1449
Very easy, and an excellent professor. I hope to take more from him at a higher level.  I did not expect to learn much from this intro course, as I already know much about the subject. Indeed, there wasn't much new for me in the curriculum or the readings, but by virtue of Prof. Lacy, I learned a surprising amount. Prof. Lacy is highly responsive to student comments and questions both in and out of class, one of the best profs I've had in terms of responsiveness. He allows the class to go on tangents quite frequently, but they're always relevant tangents that students don't seem to mind, either related to the day's lecture, a future lecture, or related material. He grades a little too easily, I think, and the final grade was based on a midterm, a final, and two two-page papers - each two-pager was weighted the same as the final and midterm, which is a little disconcerting. But all you really have to do is show up and write four pages to at least pass.
@
Dean Lacy
/course/1449
The class was really good, but it was the teacher that actually made the material work in this case. Usually, an intro Government course is really boring because all the information is from processes we learned throughout our secondary education. However, Lacy makes sure everyone knows that basic stuff, and teaches the information that most people don't know about government and politics. This was very helpful as I gained lots of knowledge about the American Political System. He was also a great teacher who could never make a class boring. I would reccomend any class he teaches.
@
Dean Lacy
/course/1449
Dean Lacy is new to Dartmouth, and he's a really, really nice guy. While each class had some supposed central "theme" according to the syllabus, and Lacy would post notes to Blackboard for each class, he ended up going off on a million different side tangents and stories that we often only covered a fraction of what he intended to. However, I found him to be very entertaining, and he was incredibly receptive to questions. He truly loved to share anything he knew about any topic, so it wasn't too difficult to really get him off topic.  However, that said, I genuinely enjoyed having Lacy for the course. The class was ridiculously easy - and very atypical of a Dartmouth course. I don't know if it's because he came from Ohio State or what, but the entire course consisted of 2 midterms (no final!), and 2 2-page papers. That's it. Initially, I panicked because I was worried that everything was such a substantial portion of your final grade, but he was an incredibly easy grader - I was able to get an A with minimal effort. The midterms in particular were not difficult at all - a few fill-in-the-blanks, short answer identification, and one or two essays. In order to not get full credit, you had to make some really, really serious errors in your writing.  Overall, I'm pretty glad I took the class. Even though it was a 2A, I didn't find it to be boring, and Lacy was pretty good overall. However, as a side note, there was a TON of reading - easily 200 pages per class if not more.

The course thoroughly taught me the basics of how our government functions, and Lacy led the course in a very interesting way.  Class was dominated by discussions.  The assignments included two 2-page papers (which could be written on any of the readings), and two tests, which were made very easy by the review sheets that he handed out.

Dean Lacy is an incredibly interesting lecturer. Even though he goes on tangents during his lectures they are always interesting and don't hurt the students at all thanks to the study guides he provides for the tests. He is open to answering any questions as is incredibly helpful. The papers are pretty simple and the readings aren't overloading. Overall this is a great class that I strongly recommend.
@
Dean Lacy
/course/1449
Professor Lacy didn't seem to have much respect for the text we used, and as such was much more focused on his lectures. He was too responsive to questions from the class - we were knocked off our syllabus, which isn't too big of a deal.  The class had two two-page reaction papers and two midterms; the exams were very easy, especially if one looked up and reviewed the list of terms he provided before each exam.
@
Dean Lacy
/course/1449
This course was fun and easy.  Professor Lacy is a really nice guy and very understanding.  Although he tries to stick to the material, he gets sidetracked extremely easily because he wants to answer everyone's questions.  He is very knowledgable so it makes for some interesting stories and discussions, but it can be a bit frustrating to never actually finish covering the material outlined in the syllabus.  That being said, the reading more than explains what you need to know for the tests and he is a very kind grader.  We had two tests and two 2-page response papers, all of which were easy and the course was not stressful at all.  The reading is somewhat substantial but if you don't get behind it is managable.  Lacy is so far my favorite prof and this course was definitely worth taking with him.

Prof. Lacy's lectures were excellent.  He started with basic concepts and then gave many examples of the concepts in American government in the past and present.  He answered every question that we had and allowed us to explore the concepts even further.  The readings definitely were not excessive and I found them very interesting.  I'm even keeping one of the textbooks for a resource in the future.  Prof. Lacy really puts the emphasis on learning and the exams reflect that.  As long as you paid attention, you can do very well.  Overall, I recommend Professor Lacy and this class very, very highly.

This might have been the worst class I have ever taken, including highschool.  Professor Fowler would get up everyday and ramble on about Trump.

Great course, great topic, great professor. A lot of reading, but she went over it all in class so if you didn't do it you could always catch up. Two midterm in-class essays and a final paper. Also, a mock senate simulation which was pretty cool. Fowler is one of the best.

@

/course/1449
Professor Fowler is an amazing person. She is very welcoming and tries to help you to understand the material (especially during office hours). My only criticism of her is about her lecturing style, but I feel that it is mostly due to the fact that this is an intro class (very broad with long reading assignments). You  do not have to read everything word for word, but you should however, have a strong grasp for the concepts and ideas each author is arguing.   Basically, there is a paper, midterm, final, simulation, and discussions. The paper isn't too bad, and I think she's an average grader as long as you show that you are understanding the material. The midterm, again, was pretty decent. The lectures, I felt, helped with this because the questions were fairly simple. The simulation was fun, although our topic (Budget Proposal) made it a little difficult to get through successfully. The final is what killed me (counting for 50% of the grade)! She said it was cumulative over the entire course, so I spent 50% of the time looking over the first half of the course, when in all reality, the final was on the latter part of the course (and I didn't realize her final was only 2 hours and not the typical 3).   All in all, I learned quite a bit from this course. There were several readings I enjoyed and there were those I didn't. If you are thinking about a gov major, she is a good prof to take!
@
Linda Fowler
/course/1449
Although the class can be very broad and annoying at times, Prof Fowler is so nice that she makes up for it. She's willing to give extensions and just wants her students to enjoy and learn the material. The only really annoying thing about the class is how broad everything was, making it kind of hard to write the 1 short paper and the essays on the midterm and final.
@
Linda Fowler
/course/1449
Title says it. I came to Dartmouth hoping to find great courses--this one fulfilled my expectations.  Lectures were interesting and inspiring. I usually am half asleep in lectures; not so in this class. Fowler knows the material and knows how to teach.   Fowler is also a very considerate and generally helpful and kind person. Helped a lot in office hours, even with some non-class stuff in the subject area.   Readings were a bit long sometimes, but they did help, and they did include supporting/more detailed material not in lecture.  Final exam was deadly hard--3 essays in two hours. Be careful to budget your time really well...  We had a Senate stimulus bill simulation, pretty fun. Took up lots of people's lives for about 2.5 days though...   Overall, what made this course shine is that Fowler is a superb lecturer who communicates her expert knowledge of the subject well, and generally a very considerate and helpful person.  I would recommend her class to anyone with interest in American government.
@

/course/1449
This is a great introductory course. There is a lot of reading, most of which you don't have to do before the next class. the reading comes in handy when you write your papers. she asks that you include authors to support your argument..i think this is her way of checking to see if the reading has been done.  we had an in class midterm which sucked. there wasn't enough time to answer the second question.  she's great in office hours..and gives some good feedback on the papers.  def. take this class with her..you will learn a lot.
@
Linda Fowler
/course/1449
This course's material was pretty basic, particularly if you know a lot about American politics already.  Prof. Fowler is great, and allows you to use any material you bring with you on the exams, so mindlessly memorizing facts isn't a priority, like it is in some other classes.  There's a lot of in-class discussion, which is usually pretty interesting.
@
Linda Fowler
/course/1449
She's definitely a tough prof but she's also a really good lecturer and she has loads of experience which she draws on in class. She also invites random senators to give lectures.   She's definitely not one you can BS your way out of and she'll be very blunt with you. And she doesn't curve/round grades.   But if you like American Politics and simulations, you'll like her class.

Gov 3 seems pretty dull. I was fully expecting to go to the first few days and opt out into maybe gov 5 or 4.

Gov 3 is a pretty interesting class, and I enjoyed learning about our government. However Clough was just an awful teacher. Her lectures were like a jr. high student giving a presentation in front of the class. She was always stumbling over words and having to stop and look at her notes. She would make a few power point slides every day for class that generally weren't helpful. The reading wasn't too bad and neither were the exams. About 1/3 of the classes were spent in debates in which you had to do one for the term, so it was a complete waste of your time to go listen to groups debate except for when it was your turn. Take the class cause its a good class but dont expect anything good from Clough.
@
Emily Clough
/course/1449
Clough is quite possibly the worst professor of all time, let alone at Dartmouth. Not only did she have a poor command of the subject, she spoke to the class as though we were retarded kindergarteners ("ok class. who can tell me how many branches of government we have??"). Failure to respond to her attempts to engage the class was interpreted as lack of knowledge on our part and the questions were dumbed down accordingly. Clough takes attendence as part of your grade (the only fair part of her grading) so you can't escape the triweekly torture of her grating voice and dull "lectures" (mainly reading from our high school civics-esque textbook). Don't take this class. Change your major if you have to.
@
Emily Clough
/course/1449
Clough was a miserable professor who had not yet mastered the material she was supposed to be teaching.  The classes weren't at all worthwhile, especially considering the fact that the professor couldn't adequately answer any of the student's questions.  She also had a skewed grading system in which it was impossible to get full credit on some questions--even if one included MORE information than was given during the lecture or in the readings.

Michael Herron
/course/1449
Very easy and straightforward class one midterm and one final with short answer questions based on major concepts covered in lecture, and a few short, easy homework assignments. Herron has a very quantitative bend so you'll cover a little bit of median voter theorem and similar concepts, but beyond that it's basically what you'd expect out of an introductory American government course-- checks and balances, roles of the different branches, Constitution and state's rights, etc. Herron is a funny and engaging Professor, and the readings are more or less optional if you attend all the classes.
@
Michael Herron

As a Government major with a concentration in American Government, I expected this class to focus on American politics.  However, Herron, while a very nice man who is actually a statistics professor, turned it into a class on game theory and statistics.  The class moved slowly and was little work, but Herron made an interesting subject into something that was actually pretty boring.

While this class was fairly easy (with an easy textbook and minimal assignments), Professor Herron made the topic of American Politics incredibly boring.

This was a really interesting class and I feel like I've really gained a lot from it. However, you need to put in effort if you want to do well as there are assigned readings before every class and they can be difficult to understand. There are also weekly tests but they're pretty short and easy. The professor is great and he makes you understand everything he's teaching and has helpful office hours. He's a great grader as well. All in all, it's a really fun class and Professor Sorens makes it even better.
@
Jason Sorens
/course/1449
This class is an incredibly interesting one both if you are looking for a starting point in a Gov major or if you are a different major looking to learn a bit more about American Politics. Professor Sorens is pretty great. He is one of those special professors at Dartmouth that teach a political subject but also manage to remain completely unbiased, instead giving leading questions and comments that lead to further discussion in the class. The structure of the class isn't too difficult. There are readings before each class, and one quiz each week over the readings, which comprises 48% of your total grade. The quizzes aren't incredibly hard to get a B on, but it takes a bit more effort if you want an A average on them. 12% of the grade comes from participation, and the remaining 40% is from three short essays you write that comprise your final, so there is no final exam.   The readings are fairly intensive (though not that difficult), so be prepared to spend at least an hour or two on the readings. Professor Sorens does a good job of keeping the lectures interesting. I would highly suggest taking Gov 3 with Professor Sorens.

Not really what I expected going in, but still an enjoyable class. Learned a lot from the lectures and Prof. Sorens kept them super interesting and easy to follow. It took me a while to get into a groove with the readings, as they were often pretty dense and usually required some re-reading, but my weekly quiz scores gradually got better. Gov 3 was definitely a good class which I enjoyed taking. However, this is by no means a layup. You have to do the readings and listen in the lectures because any of it can come up in the quiz. Even with the generous curve, not doing the readings/not listening is gonna land you a C.

Jeff smith is a nice guy and passionate about the field.  His lectures are interesting and the tests were relatively easy.  He was always actively trying in influence his students' political views and was very intolerant of conservative thinking, which was annoying most every day.  If you can deal with the most extreme liberal perspective on politics currently alive in teaching, take this course, its little work and a way to get a good grade.

Have you read the Constitution? Do you, on occasion, peruse the New York Times? If so, you won't exactly LEARN anything in this class, but you can display that knowledge and perhaps boost your ego to some extent, which is a nice thing, especially in the summer months. I would assume you get a SOC for this class? If for some reason you dread this distrib, this class would allay your fears. Anyway, if you need to take a gov class, or ever need an easy third or fourth class, this is a pleasant if occasionally tedious option.

the material wasn't especially difficult, but he taught it in such a confusing and unhelpful way that it made even simple topics confusing.  all of the tests are multiple choice and very poorly worded.  and to top it off the final was 50% on a chapter we were told not to read.  in all, no one really has to worry about this anymore because cohen left, but it was miserable. i hear better things about bucci's psych6

The readings taught you a lot of stuff, but the tests were very confusing and didn't seem to reflect the depth of material you learned. On every test the prof would have to make serious adjustments to questions and answer many questions about the tests while we were taking the test. I found this very annoying. So while neuroscience itself is an interesting subject, this class was a letdown for me.

cohen is not a good lecturer and his slides are completely nonsensical and irrelevant; the tests are ridiculous, he tries to cram way too much material into a 30 question multiple choice test; the text, while fairly interesting, often has nothing to do with what he chooses to test over
@

I found that there was just too much information coming at me at once.  At the time I wanted to be a neuroscience major so clearly I was very interested in the subject material.  All the tests are multiple choice (as is unfortunately the case with almost all large lecture psych classes) and I am just not a multiple choice test-taker even though hypothetically this type of test should be easier!  I guess the fact that the information is all crammed in there is more a fault of the quarter schedule than the course itself which is something I as a freshman had not gotten used to yet.  The course material is incredibly interesting.  Professor Cohen likes what he is teaching.  You can tell he is very interested in it himself, but his lectures are not very exciting to listen to.    The part where I learned the least was when the TA lectured.  I know that TAs are learning how to lecture, but it was unfortunately placed in the last week and a half of class when all the material was 'coming together' in some fashion and I just got totally thrown off course by the TA's lack of lecturing skills while trying to mentally wrap up the course.

All in all, the Professor made the material accessible--the book was ok, but the lectures were much more interesting and easier to understand, and it was not tedious as a 10A.    The Quizzes?  There were tricky questions on each one, and they often included detailed material only covered the day before.  Take good notes and devote a couple hours to reviewing them, (if you can find the time, read the appropriate chapters), and you should be fine.  Ask questions during/after lecture--the Prof was really good about answering, and most of the material is interesting. T-points help, if you're concerned about your grade.

worse class ever i thought i wanna be a neuroscience major but after this class i stop considering neuro cohen's lecture is boring, and he always confuses the class.  the weekly quiz is not a fair assessment, you will get tested on wednesdays on material taught on tuesday's lecture i definitely don't recommend anyone to this class unless....u are sure abt doing neuroscience major

I'm a prospective neuroscience major, but this class came close to changing that fact. Cohen's lectures have a tendency to be convoluted, incomplete, and jump from clarity to obfuscation. In addition, he is effectively unavailable outside of classes except for limited office hours, and seemed to act as though you were wasting his precious time when asked about class materials (though he showed more humanity on matters outside of class). The quizzes often tested the most meticulous details of lectures or readings, and were not an accurate portrayal of the broader class material. I did--and do--have a fascination with neuroscience and its implications, but given a choice, I would've taken it with someone else.

The TA was a better lecturer the two classes he led. Cohen is jumpy and inarticulate. If you have to take the class, no sweat it isn't tooo bad, but dont take it out of interest you may as well pick up the book. The quizes are sort of weird too but you can do fine (B range) only working the day of the quizes and the day of the final.

This class is a requirement for the neuroscience major.   I love neuroscience and most of the classes I've taken for this major have been enjoyable. Except for those classes taught by Cohen. Cohen is a very condescending professor. He fails to understand that we are just students trying to grasp the concepts of the course, and therefore needs to teach us and not look down on us.   His lecture slides were very helpful but had some mistakes in grammar that may have made the material unclear at points. Cohen's lecturing skills however were very poor. He often made mistakes in explaining the material and has a very annoying (diet Coke induced), high energy way of talking.   The quizes were surprisingly difficult. I am a science buff and having taken the other neuroscience requirements, already knew most of the material coming in. However, the quizes were testing minor details that took away from the important aspects of neuroscience as a whole. Also, some questions were poorly worded. The professor was not helpful towards questions during the quiz so don't waste your time there. On the other hand, the quizes were only about 30 minutes long or shorter.  Despite Cohen, however, I enjoyed this course because I am fascinated in the subject. If you like neuroscience as well, don't let this horrible professor discourage you.   Do's and Don'ts. Do memorize the slides and the tiny irrelevant details. Do read the book. Don't go to office hours. Don't talk to Cohen. Study for the quizes. Get those free Tpoints.

Okay, so you may here people moan and groan about the multiple choice quizzes.  It's true, they weren't very good reflections of what was stressed in lecture.  However, I did like the whole set up of having weekly quizzes; it forced me to keep up with the material.    Prof. Cohen is a little quirky, but a great guy.  He provides unique insight and interesting anecdotes, many of them hilarious.  And moreover, he is always available to talk.  I highly recommend this class to anyone who is interested in neuroscience.
@

The beginning of the course is awful because you either already know all the material or you're hopelessly behind. It gets a lot better, though prof cohen seems to get even more spastic and unclear. The new book is a pretty good resource, though.
@

DON'T take this class.  It was by far my worst at Dartmouth.  Professor Coen's lectures are horribly boring, and are all based on powerpoint slides that are often vague and don't make a lot of sense.    The one nice part of the course is that he uses a weekly quiz system instead of midterms, which helps take a little pressure off.  But his exams are based on random details from his lectures and are very hard to prepare for.    Avoid this one if you can.
@
Yale E.
/course/2478
The weakest part of this class was the quality of lectures. I often felt like I was going to class to have someone read the powerpoint slides to me. While Cohen seemed to know his stuff, he didn't convey the gist of the material very well and definitely didn't inspire interest in the subject. I can see someone interested in perhaps majoring or minoring in neuroscience being turned off from taking this class.  If you have to take this class for whatever reason, my advice is to not buy the book, because I used it about 2 times throughout the whole course. The powerpoints pretty much contain all the material you will be tested on. The quizzes are sometimes a little frustrating, but you get to drop your lowest grade.
@

Cohen is a really bad prof - he has no idea what he is talking about, he can't explain anything, and he gets really confused while he is teaching - he often uses the wrong words and gets things mixed up and is really hard to understand.
@
Yale E.
/course/2478
Firstly, Cohen is not a great lecturer.  he tends to confuse words like 'increase' and 'decrease' or reverse concepts altogether.  he also relies heavily on the ppt slides.  You have a multiple choice 'quiz' every week, and that's the only graded material. So, even though you learn new material on tuesday, and are quizzed on wednesday, Cohen will not answers questions over blitz. also, the quiz questions are about minute details that were mentioned maybe once.  The TA is even worse.
@

/course/2478
When I read the reviews for this course during fall term, a lot of people complained about the quizzes.  (This course has weekly quizzes that count for 75% of your grade, and a final that counts for 25%).  However, I thought I could handle them, and with a lot of studying I would do ok.  That is NOT the case.  Professor Cohen somehow manages to reduce 150 power point slides into 20 multiple choice questions.  That's right, no partial credit, nothing, just pick a letter, and if you guess wrong, boom, there goes 5% of your grade.  While most of the questions are fair, there are a few bad ones in each test, and this is enough to mess you up.  While he does test mainly from his powerpoint slides, he gets a lot of his test questions from the book, and on a couple tests, we had questions about terms that he had never covered in class, but I found out later were in the book.  Also, there are some questions that are just poorly worded.  If you love neuroscience and plan on majoring/minoring, by all means take this course.  The material was, for the most part, quite enjoyable and interesting.  However, if you are just look for a science class that sounds fun, in order to fulfill your distribs, seriously consider another class.  While you won't do well on the quizzes if you don't study, studying hard won't necessarily get you the grade you want.  Also, while he claims that the class requires no previous knowledge, the kids who have taken bio 19, or are taking bio 15, have a serious advantage, because a good chunk of the most detailed molecular portions of the class are covered in bio 15 (as i learned from a friend taking both classes concurrently).

I took this course as a science distrib.  It wasn't too hard or too interesting, but I'm not really that interested in the subject anyhow.  The weekly quizes were nice because they were short and didn't require too much studying.  It was good for a distrib.

This course is perhaps one of the most lackluster courses at Dartmouth. The idea and the concept of the course was excellent; however, the execution of the course was downright horrible. Cohen is a horrible lecturer, both banal and disorganized. His lack of ability to effectively communicate makes lectures not worth attending (which I quickly found out after week 2). Moreover, he is contemptuous and disdainful towards students who ask questions, often giving the attitude of "Wow, that kid is really stupid," or worse. Frankly, Cohen doesn't care about the students at all. The course material could be interesting; however, it is difficult to understand if one has not taken biology or physics, especially since Cohen places a high emphasis beyond that which is necessary on the latter (he was an electrical engineer).   Bottom line Don't take this course. If you want to be a psych major, take psych 1. If you want to take neuroscience, take it through the bio department. As long as Cohen is teaching it, don't take it.
@

The material was fascinating, but Prof Cohen was not helpful. Lectures were somewhat disorganized and boring. Unreceptive toward questions. Going to class did not improve my grades. Be prepared to be learning the material on your own (which is feasible by using the book and powerpoints).  The quizzes are generally on topic, so it is possible to do well with reasonable amount of effort.
@
Yale E.
/course/2478
I enrolled in this class genuinely interested in neuroscience.  The first weeks I thought the class was ok, and that the reading really helped me learn the material. This continued until our first quiz, and the class went downhill on the subsequent weekly quizes.  The quizes and grading do NOT test the pertinent class materials that showed you learned the class material.  They mainly consist of trivial details that probably make this prof giggle when he writes them (those really annoying multiple choice tests.)  Furthermore, when confronted about why the quizes are so trivial, this prof makes sure that you know why you were wrong-- he makes no effort to help you out.  Going to his office hours was like entering a criminal court room and asking him questions during the quizes reminded me of the spanish inquisition.  I might not be a pre-med or bio major, but in my four years at Dartmouth this will be the worst class I have ever taken.  I strongly disagree that you take this class, unless it is not taught by Yale Cohen.
@

This was quite an interesting class -- you'll learn a whole lot about neuroscience.  It's a good primer.  Prof. Cohen is a pretty good lecturer, although at times he'll get confused and trip over his words, or even lose his meaning completely.  Doing the readings is essential -- the information is presented in a much more organized way.  I recommend doing them BEFORE the class in which they're discussed so that you don't get completely lost.  Quizzing was a little weird -- often there was no time to review the material, because it had been taught the day before.  Cohen is remarkably unhelpful outside of class; if he feels he's already answered a question that you ask him, he will refuse to reiterate the answer, and instead will tell you "I already sent a blitz out about that," etc.  Which seems petty to me, but I digress.  In any case, this is a good class if you are a self-motivated learner, because it is interesting, but you really have to take some initiative in order to absorb the material.

Good lectures, blackboard slides, and coverage of the material. You learn a lot, but I dont think I appreciate the knowledge very much... it's just not as exciting or interesting as I thought it would be.
@

Cohen lectured straight off the powerpoint slides, usually not for the whole class period.  The course was about the absolute most minute details of the mechanics of the brain and almost never about the brain as a whole.  I learned almost nothing about the things that make one human different from another, although I did learn ohm's law and a fair amount about electrical potential.  The quiz questions were about picky details from the powerpoint slides and often didn't really reflect whether you understood the processes going on or not.  But it's not much work if that's what you're looking for.

Pretty cool class, great intro course if you've never had a science. If you do have a good background, however, the material may seem tedious and extremely vague. Prof Cohen is really funny, and I enjoyed his lectures a lot. Unfortunately, because this was an intro class, his effort to dilute the material made for a lack of clarity, particularly in weekly multiple choice quizzes. Even if you have a good grasp of the material, these quizzes are frustratingly unclear and will trip you up. Topics covered electrical signaling, signal transduction, and development/memory/plasticity thrown in at the end.

I liked the way the tests were administered... several quizzes about once a week. That was a lot less stressful than the normal midterm format because it was only a weeks worth of material at a time and it made the information easy to keep up with.

This class is easy, very easy.  Lectures should be thought of as optional as should class reading if you are willing to get a B+ / A- and do the T – points.   This class was also really really dull.  Both of those should be qualified I took bio 34 last term.

The professor is spastic and horrible at explaining concepts in class.  His quizzes had really confusing and ambiguous questions.

Please do not take this class.  It is by far the worst class I have ever taken.  Prof. Cohen is NOT a good professor by any means.  His lectures are confusing (and when a girl pointed this out in class he replied indignantly "It's your fault you can't read my slides correctly" even though everyone felt the same way), his weekly quizzes are terrible (especially because there is always at least one question that he never taught us the material for), and he's just a jerk to people.  He can't answer questions and he tries to dumb things down for us even though that just makes everything more confusing.  I am terribly disappointed by this class because I had once considered being a neuroscience major...my dreams have been trampled on by this one man and I may never get over that.  I mean, I will, but I'm just trying to emphasize to you how much you should not be considering taking this class.  Dont' do it.  And don't trust anyone who says it's good...they're just lying to you...or themselves.

Overall, the class was pretty interesting.  Prof Cohen is really funny and random, and is more than willing to answer any questions after/during class and during office hours.  There are weekly quizzes (scantron) which are not too hard but a little tricky, since the questions can be ambiguous.

i found it difficult to stay for the entire time - though i find this to be true for most of my classes.  the quizes were straight from the ppts - all mutiple choice.  cohen usually kept the class interesting and was very understanding when i failed a quiz bewcause of a medical issue - he dropped the grade.
@

The first half of this course is pretty much focused solely on the physical functioning of neurons and involves some fairly difficult material that draws from physics, chemistry, and biology.  So if you come into it expecting to learn something about psychology/behavior and that kind of thing... you may be somewhat surprise, perhaps even frustrated (as I was).  Later in the course, when it starts to focus more on perception, memory, and learning, the lectures are more stimulating and engaging.  And Cohen is better at explaining the material as well.  Overall, he's a fairly good professor, but sometimes his explanations are inadequate and if you listen really hard to what he's saying, sometimes it's verging on gibberish.  But one on one, he's pretty good at breaking down the more complicated concepts... If you study a decent amount the day before the quizzes (which are weekly), you'll do well.  It's not too hard to get a good grade in the class.
@

Neuroscience is really cool. Cohen's lectures were good, I thought, and he definitely encourages questions. The book isn't really needed, it's just reference, no readings were assigned from it.   My one problem was the quizes/exam. I thought Cohen did a poor job of looking over the questions, so he often had to clarify them in the middle of the test.
@
Yale E.
/course/2478
This is not a bad class, but it certainly could be better. Professor Cohen is a good prof, very willing to answer questions in and out of class, & his explanations and powerpoint presentations are generally clear, that is if you can stay awake for the powerpoints. It's really very difficult to stay awake, not because the presentations are boring, but because the class is 2 hours long, in a dark, warm lecture hall, @ 10 in the morning. And there's no student participation, really, beyond taking notes, which makes it a lot harder to stay awake. (I guess that's normal for a science lecture course, but I much prefer classes where your presence actually makes a difference.)Going to class & staying awake for lectures does make a difference, though. Even though you do get powerpoint slides to memorize afterwards, it really helps to be there & hear his explanations.   The most annoying thing about the class is that your entire grade depends on quizzes, given every week during the x hour from 3 to 4 on Wednesdays. There are usually somewhere between 20 & 25 questions on the quizzes, so missing a few really lowers your grade. & the quizzes really do not fairly evaluate whether or not you know the material. He claims the questions are clear and only one answer makes any sense, but that's not true at all - they're confusingly written, & often more than one answer makes sense, & he doesn't allow you to argue answers. Really, they're as much about understanding what he means by the question as they are about knowing the info. (If you don't know the stuff, you'll do badly, but you won't necessarily do well if you do know it.)   This class rewards surface memorization more than actual comprehension or curiosity about the stuff you're learning. We learn that an ATP replaces an ADP without being told that that just means adding a phosphate group, because stuff like that is too "in depth" for the class.   A couple tips for the class DO NOT read the textbook - it doesn't help at all & the info is never tested. Just memorize the slides really really well & don't overthink the questions (easy to do, 'cause they're not always really explicitly written.) & get T-points, extra credit points from participation in psych experiments. They'll pull you up half a grade, but only if you're above the median in a grading level.

When I saw this course in the ORL, I really wanted to take it.  It looked like it would be interesting, challenging and fun, and I thought it would be a new experience--different from high school classes.  But I was very sorely dissapointed by this class. I would not take this class again, and I would not recommend it to anyone else, not because the course material is bad but because the professor is. The class had no variety. Every period, the professor simply read off a power point slide lecture from a projector overhead. He kept the lights at the perfect dimness to induce sleepiness, and the boring approach he had to teacher fostered, along with the dark atmosphere, the perfect conditions for falling asleep in class, so that it was very difficult to stay awake during class, much less concentrate on what was being said.  Also, professor Cohen was very misleading about the nature of the course. He said he would not assume a lot of outside knowledge about biology, chemistry or physics, but the questions on tests did require an outside knowledge of such things.  Also, the quizzes and final did not seem to be a fair evaluation of mastery of material. there were 7 10-15 question scantron quizzes throughout the quarter that was worth 75% of the grade.  The questions did not seem to test concepts, but rather see if students memorized every anal detail that ws not necessary for understanding concepts. Also, the professor did not give quizzes back in a timely manner, so that students whose performance on quizzes was poor would not know that until after it was too late to make improvement (there were no more quizzes). The final was also a 50 question scantron test which was much like the quizzes. In general, my opinion of Professor Cohen is that he is too lazy to make the class a real class, and it was a waste of my time and money to take such a bad class. I feel frustrated that Dartmouth has such a poor quality class to offer students, and my only hope is that Cohen's class is an exception rather than the rule.

the room was so dark you can't help but fall asleep. The prof did nothing except reading off the powerpoint slides. Sometimes it's better to stay home and read the book while going over the slides, it's pretty much the same thing.

It was so difficult to stay awake during this class.  The material was not really interesting TO ME.  The professor  He was allright.  He was actually funny in class and always made jokes.  I remember once after I had a really bad grade that I went up to his office to talk over my grade and he was really friendly and told me just how accessible he is outside of class.  But the truth is that he's really not that acessible.  He really makes it difficult for someone to come to him with questions.  My advice to anyone that wants to take the class though is this  Be ready for the level of detail that this class has.  So much detail that every little thing matters.  You can't get by in this class by just knowing the basic "concept".  Be ready to study in DETAIL for the class.  If you know this, and study hard, I suppose you'll be fine.  And o by the way, the book was crap.  A total waste of time because it was so difficult to read.  It went into too much detail and most of the time, what you'll actually have to read is only a paragraph of the whole thing.  I wish I hadn't bought it!

While it sounded really interesting and some of the lectures were interesting, the quizzes were really specific and not really related to the concepts and ideas that we learned.  The atmosphere of the class also needs soem help (the lights could have been brighter).  The professor knows a lot about this subject and he tries to teach as best as he can and he does well for an introductory course--a huge amount of material has to be covered in a short period of time.  The textbook was a horror though, way too in depth and advanced for us; it was a waste of money and did not help us at all in the class.  The quizzes were based solely on the lectures and only those who memorized could do well.  They also could have been returned in a more timely fashion.

The class was fine, Prof. Cohen gave interesting lectures, the only drawback was I had it on a T/Th so of course the class was super long.  The readings from the textbook were the worst/hardest part.  The book made no sense whatsoever, but it still helped a little if you read it like 10 times over.  Skipping classes wasn't too smart of an idea but just make sure you go over the lectures (which he posts on Blackboard) and read the confusing book!  And ask questions in class, he'll answer them!  The class itself was very informative on the subject of Neurosciences, although I'm still not entirely too sure where the psychological portion fits in, besides that this is really a biology class that fits under the psychology title.  Want to be a psych major?  I say shoot for Psych 1 first, unless you are entirely too sure that you want to take Neurosci.

Cohen started out by telling us that this class was going to be straightforward, and definitely made it sound feasible.  The class is anything but straightforward.  The textbook is horrible - everything in it is way beyond what we learn in class, plus there's stuff we learn in class that has nothing to do with what's in the book.  His slides are helpful, but you wouldn't know it from taking his tests and quizzes, which are really nit-picky multiple choice questions that are designed to trick you out.  That said, Cohen is a really nice prof.  If you really don't understand anything, he will do his best to help.  It doesn't always work, but at least he tries.  He's a very approachable prof, and will definitely help you understand the major concepts in the class.  But you still won't be able to pass his tests and quizzes unless you memorize his slides word for word.

Contrary to the other reviews, I found this class to be extremely interesting.  The professor did a fairly good job explaining the concepts.  His lectures and comfort level improved as the course progressed.  Professor Cohen showed that he was really interested in the subject and this was apparent through his enthusiasm.  Since there were weekly quizzes, you had to keep up with the readings and stay on top of things.  I found the quizzes to be challenging but fair.  the wording on the quizzes were sometimes confusing but Professor Cohen was in class to clarify them.  The quizzes and the final covered conceptual material.  I never went to Professor Cohen's office hours but he seemed approachable.  OVerall, it was a challenging but interesting class.

I can't speak enough about how much I enjoyed being in Professor Choen's class.  Usually material such as this can be tedious and confusing but I think he did a wonderful job of explaining it and making sure everyone was on the same page.  He set the class up so that you had a quiz each week (a total of 7 for the term and you could drop the lowest one) and then a final.  The quizes were challenging but not rediculously hard, if you went to class and reviewed your notes before hand, they were fine.  This overall was a good class, with interesting material, and a great prof.

You received exactly what you would expect, however due to my own fault, I let myself slip in this course too much. To describe it in two words Deceptively difficult.

Well, the potential for a neuroscience class to be interesting and inspiring is pretty good since it is such unique information; However, this class sucked. It was somewhat interesting and I learned a lot but the process to learning almost killed me and my friends in the class.  Cohen is a nice guy but he completely makes fun of students during review sessions by rolling his eyes and refusing to answer questions he believes to be too simple. He is known to look up and say "What are you trying to ask? You should know that". If you need to take this class, work hard, prepare to be tortured and you'll be fine. If not... RUN AWAY!!!

Professor Cohen seems to be a really cool guy...funny and approachable.  As the class progressed, however, he became extremely condescending and arrogant.  He would always make it clear that he was easy to approach outside of class...BUT as soon as i went to office hours he gave me the feeling like I was stupid for being there.  He is the WORST explainer.  I know people who wouldn't even come to class because he would confuse them more.  Honestly, during the review sessions people would sometimes laugh at his responses because they were so far-fetched and abstract. I think he was just too smart to explain things on a normal human level? not sure.  overall, his attitude sucked.  sometimes when i asked questions during the test he would roll his eyes at me. The material itself was extremely interesting but his lectures could turn anyone off to the subject.  They were extremely unorganized and scattered.  He would speed through the slides not explaining any one thing in depth. Also...his exams are impossible! 50 multiple choice questions on 400 pages of lecture printouts is extremely hard to do well on. The questions were often badly worded and far-fetched.  He used lots of hypotheticals and unclear sentences.  People could have done a lot better in the course if the tests weren't multiple choice. sorry for the long review...just had lots to say. hated it.

Few subjects, I think, have the potential to be so fascinating as neuroscience, and yet Professor Cohen, through his somewhat convoluted lectures, left me uninspired.

I went into this class expecting something similar to the ORC course description.  Instead I had to sit through one of the, if not the, most boring class of my Dartmouth career.  Professor Cohen's theory behind the class was that he was going to give us a strong background in Neuroscience so that we could learn the interesting stuff later, not now.   The lectures were all from powerpoint slides.  There was so much material that even though I tried I couldn't write everything down before he went to the next slide.  I quickly resorted to just printing the lecture notes, but still the class was more of a show and tell of the slides than a true lecture.    The only good thing about this class was that there were only three exams, no papers or homework.

I took Psych 6 because I didn't know what to chose as a third course and the description sounded interesting. And the course material is pretty fascinating. It's amazing all the clever tricks our body comes up with! On the other hand, the course is a lot about facts, and that is way less interesting. The tests are all multiple choice, and although that probably makes them easier it's kind of annoying because it makes the grade dependent on knowing random facts. I would have preferred a more solid exam that tested a more conceptual understanding. Prof Cohen is a good prof. To be perfectly honest, I didn't follow the lectures that much. Strangely enough, I nevertheless consider Prof Cohen a good lecture. He's fun and dynamic, and very accessible. He will go over things many times until everyone has understood (maybe the reason I wasn't paying so much attention) So I guess in summary that my feelings about this class are mixed. I liked the prof and the material was fascinating, but some aspects, such as the exams, were really frustrating. Overall, I'd recommend it if the ORC description tempts you.

Though it sounds intimidating, Neuroscience is definitely comprehensible. The topics are very complex, but if they’re studied hard and truly absorbed, they can be grasped. But, I can’t exactly say that Prof. Cohen helped extensively in that process. His lectures are sometimes dry and his speech pattern is confusing. He constantly replaces terms with “this thing” or “that one,” and he has a tendency to stop speaking in the middle of a sentence because he thinks his point has been sufficiently conveyed.  Of course, reading the text before class did help. But, his lectures do not cover a lot of the material in the book, so studying it extensively before he tells the class which parts are important seemed like a waste. Though his slide notes could have been a useful reading guide, he didn’t post them until about an hour before class. In general, the class is tough and requires every one to do a great deal of extrapolation on the presented material, a good grade is definitely attainable.

While Prof. Cohen sometimes confuses his words during lecture and the classes move a little quickly, the class is definately interesting.  The material gets very confusing at times, but Prof. Cohen tries very hard to walk students through it until they understand it.  However, you definitely have to seek out his help in order to do well in this very interesting class.

I enjoyed this class, and got quite a bit from it.  The one problem I had with it was that occasionally the lectures were a little incomprehensible.  Granted, neuroscience is a complicated/detailed subject.  The problem was, he used power point presentations for every lecture.  Some of the slides were nice pictures which he spent a long time explaining, and some were large blocks of textual explanation which he skimmed by in under a minute.  There wasn't enough time to read the slide, much less know whether or not we understood everything on it.  It generally turned out to be explained later, it was just fairly unnerving during class.  Otherwise, this was a very interesting course.
@
Yale E.
/course/2478
Intro to Neuroscience is an incredibly interesting class, although the lecture format can be soporific at times.  Professor Cohen's energy and sense of humor, however, added greatly to the interest factor.  He was extremely willing to interrupt his Powerpoint presentations to answer questions, and was bouncy and jubilant while doing so.  The material itself wasn't too difficult, but one needs to be sure one grasps the concepts before he leaves class.  Ask questions, it's ok, he'll answer gladly.  The tests were a fair representation of the material, and scores were generally very high.  If you're looking for a pretty interesting class with not too much outside work, decent tests, and a fun professor, then Psych 6 with Cohen is the way to go.

Just like the title says, the course work was pretty light.  Cohen has all his notes in powerpoint online so you can pretty much study from those.  The textbook is good and easy to read and goes into a little more detail than the lecture notes which is helpful for understanding what's going on.  Cohen himself is a good guy and pretty helpful during office hours.
@

Professor Cohen is a dynamic lecturer, and he really encourages interest in the course material.  It is, however, a difficult subject, and it requires more than just a good professor to pull off a good grade.  After the halfway mark or so, a lot of us stopped reading the text, because we weren't expected to be responsible for all of it, just what Prof. Cohen covered in the lectures.  Also, he put his lectures on the Public server, so if you missed class, you could look up his presentations; but even they were hit-or-miss unless you went to class.

I really enjoyed this course. Learned a lot about the neural system and how it basically controls everything we do. Bucci was also a great lecturer; very knowledgeable and entertaining. His exams can be a little tricky but are generally fair if you put effort into studying for them. The median is misleading (B for 15W); it was low only because too many humanity majors took it as a layup for distrib and didn't put enough effort into it/didn't know how to study. If you are genuinely interesting in learning neuro, I can highly recommend Bucci.
@
David Bucci
/course/2478
Course I thought the lectures were very interesting, but there wasn't nearly enough time to cover our entire 500 something page textbook. Plus, the class participation is evaluated so randomly. I know several people who missed only one or two classes and only got credit for 1/5 of the class participation points, which changed their grades dramatically.   Professor Although Bucci is a great lecturer, he was almost entirely unavailable to students. He even scheduled his office hour during our x-hour, which we usually had a lecture during. Sometimes he wouldn't even respond to emails until I had sent them two or three extra times. Here at Dartmouth, the focus is supposed to be on the undergrad, professors shouldn't be too busy with their own research to help students.   Workload The workload was fine but there were 6 exams, you have to read a dense chapter of neuroscience a night, and there's a nightly quiz that counts towards your grade. It wasn't a brutal amount of work, but it was pretty significant.

Course This was a wonderful course! The material was so interesting!  Professor Bucci is a very gifted teacher. One of his own areas of research is memory and learning....so you can surely imagine that he would know how to teach well. Additionally, Bucci is just a really cool guy, and he makes class fun and exciting.   Workload Lots of reading; but it was interesting reading. We read a chapter for every class, and we used quite a few x-hours too. Each chapter was anywhere from 25 to 40 pages. For each chapter, we took a "pre-quiz" online before the class dedicated to that chapter (to make sure you read). The quizzes usually took under five minutes to complete, so they weren't a big deal at all. This course had a heavy reading load, but it was made more manageable by Prof. Bucci's "Reading Guides" --- he told us what to focus on in the chapter so we wouldn't get too caught up in the details.

This class is awesome. Bucci is fair, a good lecturer, and the tests are fair. Know everything on the powerpoints. But the textbook for this class was probably the best part, it was really interesting!   The stuff you learn in this class is stuff you will need to know for the rest of your neuro major, constantly relearning it. I kept the textbook and still look over it for refreshing basic concepts. Overall, excellent class, great material. The neuro major is such a fun major, so if you are interested, take this class and consider the major!
@
David Bucci
/course/2478
Bucci is extremely reasonable about this class.  he doesn't expect to teach you everything about neuro.  He wants you to learn the underlying biological mechanisms of neuroscience because things just wouldn't really make much sense without knowing how neurons interact and send messages, etc.  Some people really don't enjoy this aspect of the course but i think it was pretty necessary.    ANYWAY, it was completely reasonable because he taught a completely manageable amount of information.  Yep, there were 3 exams and there probably 5-7 chapters on each exam, but that's pretty reasonable.  If you try hard you can do well on all of the pre-chapter quizzes (he does this to make sure you're reading) and you get points just by answering the clicker-questions (to make sure you come to class).  And, with t-points, you're able to really have control over your grade.  The first exam everyone studied hard for and did well on, but the second exam people studied less hard for because they thought the first one was so easy.  A lot of people did bad on this exam... DON'T LET THIS HAPPEN TO YOU.   What you need to know KNOW EVERY SINGLE THING ON HIS POWERPOINT.  Like, I mean everything.  With some exceptions, He doesn't really hold you responsible for things that are in the book but not in his lectures.  So that means that every single thing (even anything little) on his powerpoint is fair game.  Make sure to ASK QUESTIONS if he doesn't explain something on his power point!  The thing I liked most about this class is that the objectives were always really clearly defined.  We knew what each class period was going to be about, and we knew why we were learning what we were learning.  Bucci tries to let us know why shit is important and relevant.  You start off learning how neurons communicate with each other, and then you learn about sensory systems and motivation and movement and attention and stuff. It's a very sensible progression and you learn about how different structures in the brain relate to it.  Even though I probably won't pursue neuro or psych just because the brain doesn't SUPER fascinate me, I think this class was well structured and definitely do-able, but you're going to need to put in some work.

I'm a little scared that this course might turn some people away from neuroscience. I love the subject intensely, but this course was pretty average. Bucci's nice and all, but he's not incredible. The course is obviously a survey, but is still too superficial. At least it's really, really, easy.

This was a really great class, and Prof. Bucci is amazing. He is a great lecturer and I found the topic to be really interesting. Sometimes the readings were way more detailed than we needed to know, but he was clear in class what was important. The exams got increasingly harder over the course of the term, which was understandable. I would highly recommend this class to science majors looking for something a little less science-focused and for non-majors as well.
@
David Bucci
/course/2478
The class was less work than I though it would be.  It's up to you whether or not you want to keep up the readings, but it doesn't hurt.    Pay attention to the key points on the slides when reviewing for tests and listen in class because Prof. Bucci will hint at what material he is going to emphasize on the exams.  The exams were fair, but some questions were poorly worded and inhibited you from showing what you know.  Prof. Bucci will help you outside of class if you seek it.  He said he would try and break up the lectures with different activities or discussing a question with a neighbor.  Although these events rarely happened, for the most part his passion kept the lectures lively.  I would recommend the course to people with a general interest in neuroscience regardless of your scientific background
@
David Bucci
/course/2478
The way this course is structured makes it seem like there's a lot of reading to do, but after the first couple of classes I found I didn't have to read any of the material and could still answer all the "mini quizzes" questions fairly easily by just doing 5 minute skims over chapters. All exams are also multiple choice, which makes it easy to do well, but the curve is also pretty harsh so you can't make to many mistakes. Bucci is a great prof and inspires interest in the subject, but the way the course was formatted made me attend lectures less and less frequently as the weeks progressed. All the exam questions were pretty much directly from the powerpoints so if you reviewed them you would do well  The best thing about the psych/neuro department is the T-point system. They're fun to get if you sign up for experiments frequently (i didn't do a single one of his research summaries which were an alternative to experiments) and it's easy to get 8 t-points by the end of term, which automatically improves your grade by one step (say, a B+ to an A-) Take this course if you're interested in being a Neuro/Psych major or are just interested in the subject itself but beware of ending up not doing any work and losing interest in the subject.

This was a really great class. Bucci is a really chill guy and it was entertaining to go to class to hear his lectures. I feel like some of the textbook reading was a little unnecessary because it went into a lot more depth than we needed to know, but oh well. I'm going to major in Neuro now, so I'm probably a little biased, but I would definitely recommend taking this class. I wouldn't say it's easy but it's interesting enough for you to want to learn the material to do well. The tests can be a little tricky, but if you read the textbook, you'll do fine. Do experiments for T-points, they're annoying but worth it in the end.

This course was okay. I thought the readings were interesting and Bucci is satisfactory.  He's got a nice sense of humor and tries to keep the class interested so he gets kudos for that.  The reading quizzes are easy, the lectures are a bit of a rehash of the book though he said he'd try to avoid that.  I really had a problem with his tests though.  They are rather tricky.  He also doesn't curve so what you get it what you got.  There are probably easier SCIs out there.  I recommend EARS 9 Earth Resources.

I was worried coming into this class that I would not be able to keep up with the material, as I have a rocky history with science courses at Dartmouth.  But after the first few lectures, I was convinced that this course would be interesting and accessible to someone with little background knowledge in biology or neuroscience.  Bucci is a great lecturer and has a keen understanding of how humans learn.  The format of the course makes it hard to fall behind on material, provided that you're going to class and taking the quizzes.  Bucci is really helpful with answering questions inside and outside of class and lectures in a way that is reasonably fast-paced without being too difficult to follow.  He makes it clear up front that it is important to do the assigned reading before coming to class, so as long as you do that you'll be fine.  The few times I fell behind on the reading I got a little lost during the lectures, so it's important to stay on top of the readings...but they're pretty short and often interesting, so it's not too bad.  This was probably my favorite class of those which I've taken for no reason other than to fill a distrib.  Bucci really cares about his students and has a great sense of humor when lecturing.  He's a really nice guy, very approachable, and knows his material very well.  The few times that he didn't know the answer to a question, he was up front about it rather than trying to bs and confuse the students, which some of the other psych faculty have a tendency to do.  Overall a great class.  It's a bit of work, but definitely manageable and interesting most of the time.  Great if you're looking for a fun way to get a SCI distrib.

This course is a possible prerequisite for the Neuro major. I would definitely take this as the pre-req over Psyc 1 if you're planning on doing the neuro major. But if you're not interested in Neuro, it's still plain interesting as a science course. Prof Bucci is really great. It is his field of work so he tried to make this course as interesting, fun and easy as possible. Although the quizzes were a bit of the pain, they were there to help your grade and not just have 3 tests to base your grade off of. Try to go to his office hours if you can. He's a great guy to talk to in general.

This class was awesome.  It ended up requiring very little work.  All I did was attend the lectures, get my t-points, take notes in class, and study them the day before the test.  I ended up not doing most of the reading.  There are little 4 point quizzes that you take online after each reading.  The questions are ridiculously easy, and can often be found in the titles of the sections aka you don't have to read the entire chapter.  I really liked going to class.  I didn't find it hard to stay awake and intrigued for the entire 65 minutes.  Bucci is a chill guy, both in and outside of class.  This class is interesting because a lot of the stuff applies to everyday life.  So youre like "oh, thats how that works.  okay...".  So go to class, go to office hours, and enjoy the class.  Its a fun one.  And the grades are pretty easy.

This class is awesome! Not only did it inspire me to become a neuro major, I actually enjoyed going to class and didn't miss a single lecture. Bucci is a great prof who cares a lot about his students and wants them to do well. He puts a lot of effort into covering the basics and loves questions. He's engaging and wants everyone to participate. There are always interesting real-world examples and new research in lectures.  Tests focus mainly on key concepts rather than a million little details, but it's important to study and I think doing the readings really helps. It's a great survey course and doesn't require a science background. I'd recommend it for anyone who's even remotely interested

This was a somewhat interesting course. I liked the setup of non-cumulative exams to determine the grades, though the exam material was pretty arbitrary at times. Though I found the lectures to be a lot less factually useful than the book, Bucci tends to use a lot of random information from the lectures in his tests, so it's a good idea to go to them, even though it's not that fun as the term goes on and it's a 10A. Bucci is a nice and pretty sympathetic professor. He tries to make the class interesting, but unless you're really into really technical biology (which this course will spend a lot of time on, and Bucci says this in the beginning) it will end up being a little tedious. But it's not a bad class, and the information can be pretty useful.

The class is really really interesting and there are only four exams, 50 multiple choice questions each and they are noncumulative. The material isn't always easy, but it's not too bad if you read the book and go to class. Overall, this was a great class with a great prof. Not too hard. Not too much work either.

First, Bucci is an excellent lecturer - he is quite entertaining and can capture your interest while still presenting the material very clearly.  The book he has chosen is also excellent - very clearly written and informative, it makes the readings almost enjoyable.  The course did require a whole lot of work, just a few hours of reading per week.  And the material is pretty interesting, which makes the work feel easy.  The exams were also quite easy, which was my only quiblle with the course.  I feel like 90 is just too high a median for any exam.  I would have liked to have covered more material or simply had more challenging exams.  Overall, the best course I've had so far at Dartmouth.

I had to take the class, but would have found it interesting anyway.  bucci's enthusiastic about the subject and gives relatively interesting lectures.  the tests are non cumulative which is nice, and not too difficult so long as you pay attention and put in some effort studying beforehand.

Professor Bucci is outstanding!  He makes class fun and makes the material relevant.  The class is a lot of work, and there is a lot of reading, but if you are interested in learning about the brain and how it guides behavior, you will definitely enjoy this class.

/course/2478
What I liked the most about this class is that you could really do the readings at your own pace. Granted, the lectures were easier to understand if you had read the chapter before, but it was definitely possible to follow the lectures even if you hadn't. There were tests every two weeks, (50 multiple choice question tests that were very fair) so as long as you did the readings and studied before then it was fine. Prof. Bucci is a really nice guy and tries to make lectures interesting, although it was hard to stay alert and pay attention for the whole class because it was a 10A - that was  my only real problem with the class. Other than that, the material is interesting, the professor is nice, and the tests are fair, so it was a good class.

Being a pre-med student, I found this class to be extremely easy in comparison to the chemistry, biology, and physics classes I've taken. I think that most pre-med students should have NO problem at all, if you stay on top of the readings. The median grades on the exams were surprisingly low though, and I know that many of the non-science oriented students had lots of trouble with the course. Overall, Bucci is a better-than-average lecturer, and brings in demos and videos to make class more entertaining. It may frustrate some students that Bucci doesn't delve deeper into the science, but I think he finds a good balance overall for the diversity of the class. If you do the readings and pay attention in lecture, the tests will be pretty reasonable.

Read. All you have to do for this class is read, and just know the material. Bucci's not going to bring in something really random that was never mentioned before.   The 4 multiple choice tests are all quite thorough, but they're completely manageable.   Side note in class Bucci may seem cool, but in blitzes as well as office hours, he's a little dismissive. The class blitzes are more along the lines of "How the heck do you kids not get this" kind of tone than anything else.  Aside from that, it's a solid class.

If you are remotely interested in neuroscience take this course. I was curious about the subject and am now probably majoring in it. It's a very broad overview but it provides a nice introduction and bucci is great. also not too much work and t-points help as well.
@
David Bucci
/course/2478
This class is really all about fundamentals. This allows for coverage of a lot of different topics, but nothing in too much detail. For example, Bucci would say a few sentences on perception and then tell us to take the class on perception if we were interested. However, this was sort of frustrating because we covered topics like this so hastily it was hard to know what interested us the most.  Still, Bucci is a good lecturer and the class is undeniably interesting. It's pretty easy too- go to class and try to pay attention (not always easy during 10A's) and you'll do fine.

Psych 6 was a good intro to neuroscience, to those to may be majors to those who just have interest in the subject. Bucci is a good prof, but is not really responsive via blitz or too much so in office hours. Despite this, neuro is a really interesting subject with a ton of potential, and the textbook for the course indicates that with its fun and fulfilling readings. The tests for the course are rather difficult though, so be sure to read and review a good amount.
@
David Bucci
/course/2478
the problem with this class is that certain things are thrown at you that no one expects for example, the first exam was uber easy (median a 91 or something)but the following exam, bucci wiped some crap that shocked everyone and subsequent exams were like this so you just study harder right and you'd get a decent grade? wrong! because he has a different grading scale so if you get an 84, 86, 86, 90 for grades, you WOULD think that you'd get an A- grade WITH the extra credit tpoints right? but noooo, bucci changes the scale so that if you pull an 86 constantly, while you are still higher than the median, your grade will come out as a B+, because on his scale, an 86 is a B i ended up with a B+, though I was always higher than the median grade yeah im bitter because i did put effort in this class ps exams are scantrons--we had 4 scantron exams/quizzes  i guess it was interesting

For the majors, skip this class mentally in your dartmouth career. Yes get it over with, enjoy l life and your major.   Designed to be a "weeder" class but only because it was incredibly boring, and the tests were tricky. Looking back if all my knowledge was based only on the tests I would know nothing on the subject of neuroscience because his questions are designed to quiz you on various unimportant facts dropped during class, not really significant content from the text.   So with that in mind. don't avoid the class just get it over with. Go to office hours if you want to but remember a test every two weeks is too much time spent in moore-filene if you ask me.

@

The course covers a lot of material but leaves you wanting more, because there's no way to touch on every aspect of the subject during a 10-week term. For example, we learned all about sensory reception--how the eyes and ears take in information--but there's not enough time to go into PERception--what happens at the higher levels of the brain to make you experience, say, the "flavor" of banana. I'm an English major, but now I wish I could take another neuroscience course or two to fill in the gaps.   Bucci is very enthusiastic and very down to earth. He's able to get ideas across in an informal and engaging manner, despite the fact that he's addressing a room of 80-some people. He seems just as at ease as he'd be if you were having a one-on-one conversation with him, and this makes the material a lot easier to take in.   The course manages to cover a wide range of neuroscience topics without merely scratching the surface of each topic.

The lectures and material for this class were quite interesting. Unfortunately, the exams were, in my opinion, unfair and designed primarily to lower the class average. I would go into exams with a solid understanding of all the topics covered, and my grades did not reflect that.  Unless you are a Neurosci or Premed, I would stay away. This was not a non-science person friendly class.
@

Because it was an intro course, we never learned anything in-depth, which was frustrating at times. The text was dense and hard to understand, but Bucci explained everything very well. I recommend this to anyone interested in majoring in neuroscience, but not as a survey course for a non-major.

Keep up on the readings and study as you go along. If you don't get behind, it is a pretty straightforward class. Go to office hours; Prof. Bucci is really helpful. If you are into neuroscience, this is a good course. But I wouldn't take it just for a distrib.

/course/2478
Bucci attempts to cater to the spectrum of students in his class (from students who have never studied neuroscience at all to the student who "came into office hours every week and asked me to tell him something he didn't already know") and as a result, his exams were rather unbalanced. On one hand, it seemed like it would be impossible to fail the tests yet on the other hand it seemed impossible to get an A because he threw on obscure questions neither covered in the text or his notes, or just barely touched upon. (Perhaps for the student taking an intro class when he already knew everything...) He was unclear on what material would be on his tests and I wish he had clarified... it would have saved a lot of grief when studying EVERYTHING for the test. The good part was dividing it into 5 NONcumulative tests, but this was foiled because he didn't divide the amount of material equally. The last test must have had less than half the material (and was 2x as easy) as the 4th test.  Also, several people have told me about his snappy and unhelpful responses to blitzes, as well as his defensiveness during office hours when talking over tests. Also, if you find a mistake on a test when reviewing it afterwards with him (which is the only way to see the test in such a large class) and he gives you points back, he does NOT give any other people in the class these points back. And just because he gave you those points back does not mean he will automatically give you any points back when you go in to see him either. Overall not very consistent in this manner.  On the other hand, his lectures inspired a lot of interest in the topic, for me. (The textbook is great, too.) He's genuinely interested in neuroscience (although he insinuates that he prefers research) and it comes through in the fun, exciting supplemental material he brings in during class. So while I'm very interested in the topic now, the way he conducted the class was kind of off-putting. Although I am continuing to take Neuro classes, so I guess the interest he sparked overrode the negative aspects!

This class was pretty interesting and gave a nice overview of different aspects of neuroscience.  It helps to have a little bio/chem background, even though there are no pre-reqs.  Reading the book can be helpful at times, but not always.  Also, I was a little frustrated that he didn't put the lectures on blackboard except for the very last ones.

/course/2478
this class is pretty easy. there are just 5 non-cumulative mid-terms that make up the entire grade.  if you're good at memorization and mutliple choice you'll do fine.  the material is fairly interesting, although nothing is really covered in depth.  Bucci tries to make sure that everyone understands, which is good, but also means that sometimes it's painful to sit through explanations of very simple things that one or two people don't understand.

Neuroscience is fascinating!  This class is great for students who like biology and want to be able to apply it, or mix it with psychology.  Neuroscience is like "biology, with a purpose".   However, I was very disappointed in the professor.  Prof Bucci is a nice guy, but he is a very weak lecturer.  He "dumbed down" the material from the book, which only confused the students and/or made the lectures boring.  His exam questions, although "not meant to be tricky" were poorly written and not a great assessment of the material learned.  Despite his poor teaching, the subject was still really interesting.  Take this class! (but with a different prof, if possible)
@
David Bucci
/course/2478
I think this course could be enjoyed by both majors and non-majors (however having a background in Psyc or Cell Bio helps immensely with certain parts of the course).  The course was well organized and was presented in a very logical progression.  There were four mid-terms and a final (non-cumulative!) which sounds like a lot but it turns out to be very nice because there is not very much material on each test.  The test were moderatly difficult but very very fair.  Lectures can be interesting but get dull after awhile especially considering this course was/is a 10A.  There are a lot of things Bucci doesn't know either because the field of Neuroscience is so new.  Bucci seemed to have fairly low expectations of the students in class but I feel like that's a common occurence for newer profs.  Overall a very decent introduction to the emerging field of Neuroscience.

This class was very interesting and was not dull at all. The professor really explained the material very thoroughly and paced the material very well. He actually made the class very interesting and was very enthusiastic about the subject. The readings were not bad at all. Some of the test questions were tricky but generally the studying is very straight forward. Be at all lectures!!!
@
David Bucci
/course/2478
The first exam is really easy but don't be fooled - the rest are pretty hard and focus in on very specific details. The class itself was average. Bucci is an okay lecturer but he wastes a lot of time and has a lot of unnecessary fluff in his lectures so you sort of have to filter.   This class was not as interesting as I expected it to be. There was much more rote memorization than I expected.
@
David Bucci
/course/2478
I took this class to see whether I would be interested in being a neuroscience major, and now I'm definitely sure I want to! The course material is just incredibly interesting, and Professor Bucci did a great job giving stimulating lectures, especially considering that the class was a 10A. If you've ever wondered how your brain works, you should take this class.
@
David Bucci
/course/2478
This class was a little difficult for me and I didn't do as well as I would have liked to, partly because I didn't spend as much time on it as I should have but also partly because I didn't have the bio background that I think a lot of other students had -- I got the impression that the science majors in the class understood the material and were able to go a lot farther with it than I was.  Still, Bucci is really great and willing to help out students who are having trouble -- this is the first science class I've taken at Dartmouth and it was definitely manageable.

This class was surprisingly interesting and enjoyable. The readings are not dull at all, although some chapters are long (around 20-30 pages) and you often have to read 2-3 chapters a week. The lectures are effective although Bucci often wastes a lot of time on unimportant things or has trouble answering student's questions causing us not to be able to go over a lot of material. But he is a very fair teacher and never expects us to know more for exams than he has included in lectures. On the other hand, some of his exam questions can be ridiculous. He often tests his students on an incredibly specific fact briefly mentioned in a lecture. For one exam, the questions were multiple sentences long and you spent more time reading the questions than answering them and most people ran out of time.

Kirsten Dalrymple
/course/2478
Her lectures were based almost solely on the textbook, but she did provide different examples and mnemonic devices.  When you get to her area of expertise at the end of the term, the lectures improve considerably.   She had the TA write the quizzes, and it seemed like she didn't read the questions because some of them were picky details about things she'd glossed over.   The first exam was really easy, but then she made them harder as she figured out what people were capable of.   She was a newbie prof still getting used to the Dartmouth system, so these things might not be representative of her teaching style in a few years.
@
Kirsten Dalrymple
/course/2478
Professor Dalrymple was a really great teacher. She was fun and demonstrative and made the material easier to learn by using analogies and funny mnemonics. This was the first time I had taken neuroscience(I did psych in high school), and it was really interesting. It was exciting to look at the mind, brain, and behavior from this different perspective.
@
Catherine Cramer
/course/2478
Overall, it was a pretty good class. Cramer is not the best lecturer but she's very organized and I liked the way she graded. You had 4 tests (about one every two weeks) and a cumulative final. For the tests you could do re-tests for and get some points back which really helped your grade and also helped w learning the material, and at the end of the quarter you could drop your lowest test grade. The class was interesting but definitely a lot of work- you basically go through an 800 page textbook and if you want to keep up with the class you are reading about 25-40 pages per class, which is MWF plus the X-hour which she used every week. A lot of work, but fair grading and Cramer is a sweet professor.
@
Catherine Cramer
/course/2478
I enjoyed this course, though it was a lot of work. We read from a big fat textbook and went over a chapter at every class, so lots of reading. We also used X-hours. We got to drop our lowest midterm grade, which was great. We also got to do test-redos for some points back after each test. Professor Cramer is very knowledgeable. I enjoyed her class. This class is great if you are very interested in how all aspects of the brain work.

This class sucks so much. Way too much work and not interesting at all. Do not take if you want to have fun and not be stressed out. The class has 4 midterms so constant stress throughout the term. I think the mean has been a C on all tests so far and she is not curving it. 0 stars

Gick is a great professor, and I was sad to see him leave. That said, he seemed to kind of not care because it was his last term, so it could have been better.
@
Wolfgang H.
/course/864
Unfortunately Gick is leaving after this term, his contract wasn't renewed, but he wants to come back to teach.  If he does, definitely take micro with him, it was quite easy - tests are very long, but exactly the same as problem sets.  Questions are purely numerical and you don't really need to understand the theory, just how to plug and chug.  But Gick is really enthusiastic, loves teaching, and goes out of his way to make sure you understand the material - definitely use him as a resource.
@
Wolfgang H.
/course/864
Gick is very interested in the subject and tries to inspire that in his students.  The tests are pretty straightforward if you do all of the problem sets and practice tests.  The problem set is only due when you have to present a problem on it, but again, they're very helpful for tests.  If you don't understand something, he's very good at explaining stuff in office hours.

@

/course/864
Micro should be an easy class there is a limited amount of material, and none of it is very difficult with some studying. Gick covered all the material well, and more or less gave appropriate homeworks and tests. However, Gick apparently had a history of giving too high a median in the class, and the department was giving him grief over it. He ended up sending us a long over the top email at the end of the term describing his struggles with the department. None of this matters for you though, since he left for Harvard after this term. I hear the other econ 21 profs are tougher.

Gick cares more about his students than any other prof I've had in the econ department. He is always available outside of class for extra material or extra help.  The tests are based entirely on the problem sets and are generally time pressured, so make sure you know how to do them pretty well before you go into the test.  The slides he uses in class are for most part useless, but he does a pretty good job of explaining stuff on the board.   I think Gick is leaving, which is too bad, because I would have taken anything else he taught. He is obviously really interested in what he studies and really concerned about his students
@

Professor Gick is the best economics professor that I have had at Dartmouth.  He is interesting, helpful, and fun.  He definitely makes the topic more interesting and real world  than the textbook.  The textbook is actually great though, and one really should read each chapter Gick assigns.  The only complaint is that Gick is a stickler for time on the exams and you may run out of time, so practice being able to do the more routine problems quickly!  Overall though, I am very happy I waited to take this course with Professor Gick.  I highly recommend him.  As a final note, definitely use all the review materials and review sessions that Professor Gick offers.  These are really helpful resources, and his course website is great as well.
@

/course/864
Gick is a good prof.  While he at times can be a little hard to understand, his slides and practice problems help simplify the material.  Unfortunately he is not returning after this summer, a real tragedy considering he is the best econ prof I have had at Dartmouth.  He also made himself available until 10pm the might before our final, something no other prof of mine has ever done.  As far as the class, I don't really love calculus or micro, so it wasn't incredibly interesting, but necessary for the major.  Try to take it with Gick this summer while he is still here.

you do the problem sets. They are optional except for one problem that you have to present to the class. However, the problem set problems are very similar to the test problems so it's worth your time to understand all of the problem sets.

Prof Gick is one of the nicest people you will ever meet.  He is probably more accessible than any profesor I have ever had.  He goes out of his way to get back to students and make sure he really addresses their concerns.  Lectures can sometimes be confusing depending on how well you already understand the material.  It's probably partially because of his accent, and he moves fairly quickly in lectures (sort of assuming students know more than a lot of them do), but sometimes its hard to follow lectures.  However, its not difficult to keep up up with class as long as you do the problem sets.  If you study the problem sets and understand how to do them, you will do fine.  Also exams are relatively easy but extremely long for a very short period of time.  This makes studying the problem sets really important, because you have to work extremely fast on the exams.

why erotic? coz you get to enjoy lots and lots of slutty equations and learn the fact that many people prefer foug-less-cocb. why am I making up these stupid and lame things? coz it is really boring; most things are simple yet the lectures spend so much time on them. why stupid? because everything is impractical (how do we know the foug-less-cocb preference and many other far-fetched assumptions are the right ones in the first place). Basically, microecon is a stupid subject.  Even more stupid, why do we always need slutty equations to make things complicated when the demand function gives us all the answer already.  I guess microeconomist are just too obsessed about slvt just as Nash is about women in a bar.

Gick is outrageously fantastic. He's animated, he's enthusiatic, he's witty and even an animal-lover (there was an incident with a mouse in our class, he rescued it).  Neither here nor there, I've heard mixed reviews of Econ 21, but I can undoubtedly say that this has been a fantastic course and I would take it with Gick -- in fact I would go out of your way to take it with Gick. He's so great and the course if very manageable. I'll admit his exams were on the long side, but really you just have to go go go on them and you'll do just fine.  I loved this class and I loved Professor Gick

I was really looking forward to microeconomics, what with specializing in industrial organization and all, but Gick had the lack of foresight to choose a Tuesday/Thursday time slot for this class, and I found it exceptionally hard to pay attention for two hours or to take it seriously. For homework, he only grades you on the 1 homework problem you present to the class, but you damn well better do them if you hope to succeed on the exams.

Gick is incredibly smart, he just has issues conveying his knowledge. The exams are almost identical to the practice exams and problem sets, but you have to be able to complete them in record time; most don't finish. It's a pre-rec for the major- nothing special.
@

if you are an econ major, you need to take this class with Gick. He's lovely, gives okay lectures and everything is on slides, so going to class is not even that important sometimes. If you do the homework and the practice exam, you can take 100% on his exams with one condition BE QUICK! The material is sometimes interesting, especially towards the end of the term. Overall, a slightly more difficult Econ 1, with a very nice prof.

This makes a great third class. The tests are straightforward but *long*. Be sure to work quickly right from the start.  Gick is a very nice guy, albeit an incoherent lecturer. Doing the reading before each class is necessary to preclude the (strong) possibility of falling asleep.  Gick is very eager to help though and a lot more instructive in office hours. This class was a good learning experience, and not too stressful at that.

Professor Gick is nice but an entirely ineffective lecturer.  Most students stopped attending lectures because they got nothing out of it, except possibly more confused. You learn everything you need to know for the tests from the problem sets. Study them well, the test will be a mirror image.  The tests however are notorious for being too long for ther period he gives you to take them.  if you work fast, you'll be fine, if you work slow, you're screwed.

Professor Gick is one of the nicest professors at Dartmouth but too bad being nice does not equate with being a good professor. I only went to class because I felt bad that no one else was attending, and he obviously puts in a lot of effort in making his powerpoint slides.   All the work you have to do is just learn how to do the problem sets and for the tests you will be fine. Although his tests are long, it is just because the problems are so straight-forward (almost exactly from the problem sets) that he expects you to be able to do them quickly. So, just practice the problem sets over and over and you will be fine.

Gick tries hard, but he is very, very boring to listen to.  He is a poor teacher.  There is no real point to going to lecture, you'd do just as well to read the slides.  If kindness and an understanding of the material were all that were needed in a teacher, Gick would be great--but teaching requires much more, and unfortunately Gick lacks most of it.  A very easy class, but not at all enjoyable.

Not surprisingly, econ 21 is an extremely dull class. Price elasticity of demand and two-part tariffs cannot be made exciting, no matter how good a professor is, but Gick's lecturing style made it even harder to stay awake in class. He tends to go off on tangents and not focus well on the material we actually need to learn. He puts everything you need to know on downloadable slide sets, but he doesn't really spend his lectures walking through the tricky stuff, so there really isn't much reason to go to class.   Despite his deadly boring lectures, there are reasons to take Econ 21 with Gick. He is a really nice guy who will always help you out if have trouble with the material or just want to discuss economics in general. For one of the last classes of the term, he took the whole class to the Dartmouth Bookstore for coffee. He is also a fair grader. I didn't handle the time constraints of the first midterm very well, but did much better on the second midterm and final, so he weighed the first test less heavily and I ended up with a good grade for the course. Also, be sure to give a presentation on one of the problem set problems he hands out, because that will help boost your grade.

Gick's lectures tended towards algebra-heavy derivations of Slutsky's equation and utility functions.  These were boring and not very helpful for the actual problems.  However the book we used (Varian) was incredibly good and just by reading it and doing the exercises you can pretty much teach yourself the course without going to lectures.  Additionally, Gick is a very easy grader and gives massive partial credit on exams for writing down just about anything.  Overall a boring, but easy course.
@
Wolfgang H.
/course/864
Gick cannot lecture at all. His lectures are confusing and he has a tendency to speed through things that he deems as trivial. Going to class is a complete waste of time.  However, I would still reccomend this class to others. Gick is a really nice guy and he cares about his students. He is very approachable, even if he does sometimes have trouble communicating. He provides a ton of example problems on the web, that are essential(the only thing that is) to learning the material. With the web resources you can probably learn all you need to know for the course on your own.   Another warning. Gick's tests are very long and difficult to finish. If you are taking the class and you don't finish a test it is not that big of a deal.   Lastly Gick is a very generous grader. Overall I would reccomend taking this course with Gick.

Gick's lectures are so bad!  There was barely anyone in class ever.  But the plus is that his exams are not very difficult, only very long.  IF you work fast and just answer something for every question, you will do well.  He takes problems directly from the problem sets.  To study, all you need to do is review the problem sets and make sure you understand how to do all the problems, you don't even need to go to class.   He's really nice guy, but just not a good prof.  He puts up all his slides on a website, along with all the problem sets, practice tests and answers.

First off it was clear that the professor was trying really hard to make sure that the students understand the material.  The only drawback to the course which will most likely improve the next time he teaches the class is that the exams were too long for most people to complete in the allotted time. The first exam was the worse and nobody finished.  On the second some people finished but not very many.    On the final he seemed to have relaxed and almost everyone finished.  Overall the class wasn't horrible and Gick is probably as good a professor as any you are likely to get.

The problem with this class is that 21 simply blows. You have to take it as a major, but it's absolutely horrible because it's incredibly boring. First, NEVER take this for fun, the material is terrible, not incredibly relevent, and lots of calculus. But, if you have to take this class I may or may not take it with Gick. If you are really good at economics and calculus you will be okay because you can teach yourself everything. However, if you are average at things DO NOT take it with Gick because he is HORRIBLE at explaning things. I attended class and never had any idea what on earth he was talking about despite paying attention. Gick is a horrible professor, horrible at explaining things, class is painfully boring.  The tests are really long, don't bother knowing anything but how to do problem set and practice midterm problems, anything else is useless.  But, Gick is a really nice guy and will help you out a lot in office hours and actually cares about how you are doing. He is the most caring and approachable professor I have had at Dartmouth. He's a wonderful person, horrible professor in terms of explaining things.  Take it with Gick if you want, don't take it because you think you should only take it if you have to, but I'd suggest taking it with Bentz who may be tougher but actually explains things.

Prof. Gick has the best of intentions and really trys to make the material easy to understand.  The class is math intensive and the key to succeeding in the class is to concentrate on the problem sets.  You don't have to hand in the problem sets, but make sure you do them and understand the solutions that he provides for you.  The exams were much too long, but the problems themselves are not too difficult, the lack of sufficient time, however, makes them difficult.  In order to do well on the exams you need to be able to launch into solving the problems without really even thinking about them.

Prof. Gick is one of the better professors in the economics department. Although some students find his lectures to be fairly uninspring, he pretty much follows the textbook and is trying to add additional information to it.  His problem sets are clear and illustrate the material well. Do them and you'll do very well on the midterms since the midterms pretty much follow the problem sets.  Prof. Gick is a very friendly person, always ready to help and is always available outside of class for students with questions. Definitely take Econ 21 with Gick, it's worth it. You'll understand the material well and the tests are easy and straightforwards

Gick is a nice guy but micro absolutely sucks.  It's really boring unless you like that kind of stuff.  Gick really wants you to learn though and can't be a nicer person.  The way it's taught can be boring though..  Powerpoint slides and problem sets.

There's only so much room that Econ 21 allows for inspiration and enjoyment, so I'm not going to complain about the material being a bit dull at times. There wasn't much Gick could have done about that. What he could do, and did, was lecture to the best of his ability--He literally labored through each class to explain everything in about every way possible. If you didn't understand after that, the weekly problem sets helped, and his reviewing them in class even moreso. I doubt anyone really read the book, but it was helpful. It got a little offensive how few people attended class, but if you like to slack, his lecture slides are available on the web.   The best part of Econ 21 was undoubtedly professor Gick. He's as terrific a guy as they come, so don't be afraid to go to his office, even if just to chat. He's extremely helpful and will even come in on weekends. Don't take it with anyone else.

Straightfoward, no surprises.  Lectures are clear, powerpoint hand-outs are on-line for each lecture in case you miss them.  Tests are like the problem sets.  Gick is not a bad person at all to take this class with.

take this class with Gick.    You dont need to show up to all the lectures, as they are many times hard to understand, unclear, and very math based (which is unnecessary)  Just do the problem sets and make sure you can replicate doing those same steps on the exams and you are set.  you need basic calc knowledge.  the people that are better at math find the class much easier.  but if you arent good at calc thats ok too just memorize the necessary steps.  again, take this class with Gick. he is very nice and more importantly his median is an A-

Surprisingly really liked this class. Minimal work most of the time with a few spurts of energy for the midterms and final. The curve is also really generous.

This class is not for the faint of heart. 100% of your grade is based on 2 midterms (25% each) and a final (50%), which makes it pretty stressful. The spacing of the tests is a bit ridiculous. The first midterm was not until week 6, and the final was 11 days after the second midterm. The first midterm is also VERY difficult. Our median was a 71, and it's been even lower in past terms. The problem sets are useless for learning the material, but some of his exam questions come straight from the sets. Still, Gustman is not the worst prof to take 21 with. He is a great lecturer and explains concepts clearly. If you write down everything he says and study your notes, you will do fine. The textbook and workbook aren't necessary, but they do help reinforce your understanding of the material. The second midterm and final are MUCH easier than the first midterm. He always curves the median to an 85, so everyone got a 14-point bump on the first midterm since the median was a 71.  TLDR 21 with Gustman is stressful and the first midterm is really hard but if you take good notes and put time into studying, you will be fine.

Basically a recitation of Econ 1. We talked about marginal benefits vs cost, and then perfectly competitive firms, monopolies, etc. I didn't find the class interesting but it was definitely very easy if you are somewhat good at math (the class only covers integral and basic algebra). Problem sets due every two weeks but you are not graded for the accuracy, only for turning them in. One midterm and one final, and most of the questions have been covered in the homework.

Course Econ 21 with Gustman = ASLDKFJALK;SDFJAKLSD;FJ  Professor He understands the material and explains it perfectly. However, every he does not follow a textbook and does not have notes. There is nothing to correspond with the lecture. Most of the material is really tough, and it is not really possible to understand the material in a single hour. You need time to think and internalize before the material clicks. As a result, this professor's very clear and thought-out lecture was useless because the students did not have any way to study and fully internalize the concepts. The lecture is too fast-paced, and he speaks too fast for you to take all the notes you need. He also only holds office hours 3 hours a week, which is not really useful because I am a pretty slow student and need more help than that.  Workload Workload was manageable. The work wasn't the issue. It's the tests. Your whole grade is based on three tests. The first one was extremely hard (hardest one by far; the second and third were significantly easier). The tests only have like 10-20 questions, so be careful because every question is basically like a huge chunk of your grade. I highly recommend looking at the proofs in the notes, the homework problems, and the practice midterms/final. Many of his test questions come directly from there. Don't even open the textbook, and don't even register for the online thing (Aplia or something) that he provides. That was a waste of almost 100$. They are UTTERLY useless. Nothing in the lecture or on the tests had anything from the textbook or the online thing. I would know because I have never used the textbook or the online thing, and could do (or at least had the ability to do) every test question. Also, don't freak out about the problem sets because they are basically impossible to do and he'll go over them in class and give you all the answers. Then just understand how he got those answers and be ready to repeat or do something very similar on the test. Overall, the workload was very little, but make sure you understand all the notes and all the practice tests and homework problems, and you're set! Be aware that this is one of those classes that either you do amazing in, or you completely fail and drop out. There are very few people in between.

Gustman's exams were far too difficult. The average on the first exam was a 58... go figure. As for the material, it's pretty bland... but that's what you get with an economic theory class. It gets pretty repetitive by the end. Gustman himself is not very nice he is not at all sympathetic to students, and didn't hide his annoyance at the class when students didn't get something -- a few times, he personally derided students for their lack of understanding. Obviously, if you are an Econ major, you have to take this class. It's manageable, but there is definitely a reason it's a weeder. This was not a class I looked forward to attending.

I wasn't expecting it beforehand, but Econ 21 was actually pretty interesting. It takes a lot of small amounts of work; this class is a lot easier if you study your class notes and go and ask questions when you have them. It's not something that you want to cram last minute for, as that does not work.  The first exam was very difficult, but the second was quite simple. It's hard to get an effective read on Gustman's style of exams, but it was apparent all throughout the course that he knows what he's talking about. The material may be boring at times, and also a tad monotonous, but it's a byproduct of so much calculus being required.  I would recommend this class to anyone with a strong math background, and the class will be far more difficult to anyone who lacks such.

This class is hard, and this fact is not helped by the fact that the prof was pretty unenthusiastic to say the least. The tests aren't that bad - just make sure you really understand the homework assignments because sometimes he uses the questions on the exams.
@

/course/864
Gustman is an ok prof  THe material itself is very dry, but he's always willing to answer questions during class (unless its about elasticity, he was really mad that no one really remembered that from econ 1).  You will need lots of basic calc in the class, so brush up on that beforehand.  The tests are very difficult, especially the first one.  He does curve (27 points on the first test), but its just not a good feeling walking out of a test feeling like you failed, even if everyone else feels the same.
@

Professor Gustman covered absolutely everything you needed to know for exams in class.  So go to class and don't bother reading the book.  The homework problem sets were hard, but they were only graded for completion, and the professor went over every single problem in class.  Basically go to class, do the homework, do the problem sets, and you'll be fine.  And there was a 27 point curve on the first midterm.

@

/course/864
The Prof knows his stuff and his lectures are clear and straightforward. However, they're not particularly exciting, and a lot of it is just going over econ 1 material while acknowledging that it's all just basic calculus. The class's dryness may be unavoidable because of material that needs to be covered and the time constraints. However, I've been told that there is more interesting material in microeconomics, such as game and information theory, but for whatever reason they weren't covered. They were in the book, which was also useless. However, the work book that came with it was useful for reviewing.
@
Alan Gustman
/course/864
There's no way around it - Econ 21 is not a fun course. However, the material could have been much more tolerable had the class had a professor who could communicate the subject with the students. Having spoken to friends who have taken Econ 21 with other professors, I know that the subject is not as tedious as Gustman made it out to be, and that they ultimatley understood it better than me. He's always willing to meet during office hours, but is seldomly helpful.  In conclusion - take this class with someone other than Gustman.
@

Gustman is one of the worst profs I have ever had.  His lectures induce sleep no matter how much caffeine you consume.  His textbook is worthless, as is the workbook.  He provides only one practice test per exam, and as this is the only thing worth studying out of the provided material, it's not nearly enough to prepare for the exams.  The exams are very hard.  Almost everyone failed the first midterm this term, in both sections.  Gustman is very available during office hours, and some people found it helpful to pry a decent explanation of the material during these office hours.  However, Gustman has been around for ages and thinks his way is the only right way.  He is unwilling to compromise or accomodate even the smallest requests.  The material itself is not very hard, if it was only presented in an appropriate manner.  This class, or rather Gustman, made me question my econ major.  Gustman is one of those infamously bad profs of the econ department.  Avoid him if humanly possible, unless you're masochistic.  This course is a requirement, but there are better profs out there.

gustman knows what he's talking about, but can often speed through lectures - there'a  lot of info to cover in a short amount of time  he's always willing to stop and answer questions (although i feel like a lot of people go through lectures confused without asking questoins that he'd be more than willing to answer)  i only went to office hours once and he was really helpful  GRADING 3 problem sets for "completion" , 2 midterms (each worth 25%) and a final (worth 50%) midterms were difficult, but he curves them so it ends up averaging out - our first curve was 27 points and our second was 8!
@
Alan Gustman
/course/864
gustman does a good job with lectures and giving appropriate examples. he s very responsive and makes sure we knew what was going on. he tends to challenge us on the homework and makes us explore which could be good or bad - we absorb the material much much better but it can take a while to get the homework looking vaguely correct (there are only three prob sets though, and they are not graded). exams were pretty much as expected.
@
Alan Gustman
/course/864
The actual meat of the course was almost entirely calculus and graphs--and in general was pretty lifeless.  If you're good at keeping graphs straight and taking basic derivatives, then you won't be tricked by the material.  Despite the course's general dryness, Prof Gustman did do a good job of throwing in discussion of real-world issues, including that of his own research interests.  The text was of little help--it was easy to get lost in Prof Gustman's and the book's differences in notation and variable names.  Problem sets were mildly useful, but sort of all over the place; some questions were pointlessly easy while others were overly abstract.  The questions on the exams were quite unpredictable, though based mostly on class notes and occasionally on the problem sets.  If you're not an econ major or minor and just experimenting with economics, you could definitely find a better course to take .

This course seems to be more of a tools-building course than a course that involves practical knowledge. By the end of the course though, you've learned a lot about markets and their behavior and have the tools you need to do more advanced econ. Seems like a good course to take if you want a sampling of higher-level Econ.
@
Alan Gustman
/course/864
Basically this course involved reading the basics on your own in the textbook, and doing problems in the workbook.  And in class, Gustman provides the derivations of the concepts in the textbook.  I thought that the tests were relatively easy provided that you gave the workbook problems a try.  I had heard that Econ 21 was a pretty intense course, but didn't find it to be one.  It was pretty much just econ 1, but with easy calculus derivations, instead of logical reasoning, behind the theories.  If you're a major and planning on doubling up on econ courses for a term, take Econ 21 with Gustman.  He's a methodical prof, and the class doesn't take too much of your time.  And he's always patient with questions in and out of class.  Basically my recommendation is just to do the workbook problems.

Econ 21 isn't all that exciting. However, taught by a prof who knows how to convey the information, it become a pretty decent class.   The prof is really accessible during office hours and gives lots of practice problems (binders on reserve). The exams are fair, but sometimes a problem can be worth 20+ points (you kinda have to know what your doing...or else.)

At first started, I had no idea what was going on because I'd forgotten what derivatives were. Brush up on calc if it's been a while. The class is really straightforward, as are the tests.

Choose between going to class and doing the reading, you don't have to do both.  But definitely do the workbook problems.  I chose to go to class and found that the lectures covered everything I needed to know.  The pace of the lectures was good, and Gustman was very attentive to questions.    However, he seemed somewhat detached, not very passionate about educating his students.  Although Gustman did his job well, it seemed like he was just putting in his time.  Did not inspire much interest in the subject.

I was really unhappy with this course.  Professor Gustman is a decent lecturer, however  his testing was really inconsistant as far as level of difficulty.  In addition, the material he chose for hwk was not at all applicable to material that appears on the test.  The workbook he provides is almost entirely useless as its problems are far easier than those that appear on exams.  In addition, much of the material he spent most of the course emphasizing cannot be found in the course material in either the workbook or the textbook.
@

Gustman is great if you want to understand the material for microeconomics.  His lectures are easy to understand and given at a pace that doesn't blow you away.  However, he gives multiple choice tests but requires you to show your work.  He also doesn't give partial credit.  So after the first midterm, about 25% dropped the course and about 5% had perfect scores.

Ole Gustie is a bit of the typical Economics professor one imagines - just lost in his own research. I left the class feeling I had just learned how to play number and calculus games instead of actual microeconomics. Gustman suggests doing problems in the Orange Workbook - which are occasionally helpful. The course was pretty dry and never very interesting. There are two midterms and a final - worth 50%. Try to take ECON 21 with Bentz, so the word on the street is. But if you have to take it Gustman, it's an okay deal.
@

The class is necessary to take for the major or the minor. Most of the work for the class is done in class itself, without having to look over the textbook by yourself. There is a workbook, which is filled with exercises, and these are to be done by yourself. The exams were pretty fair although the problem sets weren't good preparation. The problem sets are not graded though. The breakdown of marks was a bit severe though (25, 25, and 50%) for the 2 midterms and final. And the timings of the midterms was also different. The first midterm was pretty late and the second midterm and the final were pretty close. The course materrial is theoretical for the most part but interesting. The course is not all that hard because it is based strongly on Economics 1. It is a very good idea to take Econ 1 before taking this course.

Ec 21 was supposed to be one of the hardest classes in the dept but I was surprised not to find it so.  Really, a lot of the material is repetitive, it's not like you learn a thousand different things in a term.  The pace is a little quick, but not too quick.  Gustman is great at answering and welcoming questions inside and outside of class and takes class time to go over exams and problem sets.  The exams could've been a lot harder; they were quite fair--the class seems to practice harder than it actually tests which is good.
@

I found Prof. Gustman very understandable and the book pretty easy to read, but it was still very difficult to figure out how to study for the tests. I kept up with the workbook problems as suggested, but they did not really help me when it came time for the test. The practice tests (you photocopy them yourself in the reserves) were easier than the real thing, and the problem sets were generally harder. The nice thing about the problem sets is that they challenge you but do not count for a grade, so you do not have to worry about getting a problem wrong. At the same time there is not really anything to buffer your grade. While the tests are generally pretty hard, Gustman brings the median grade up to an 85 (we had a 30 point curve on the second midterm if that tells you anything).

Beware of Professor Gustman. He is not malicious, but I always felt like he was sabotaging the class. The textbook often had a good, straightforward way of doing problems. Then, in class, Professor Gustman would show us a way that was incredibly complicated. I have heard that this course can be very theoretical or very mathematical- do yourself a favor and take this with another prof if you dont like the theory, because that is what this class was all about. Gustman seems to be a pretty intelligent guy, and classes were cancelled all over the place because he was constantly out of town at conferences. Nevertheless, this course wouldnt be so bad with a more interesting and engaging professor.

Prof Gustman was a nice guy. He really wants to help, takes all questions during class, and is always available in his office.  The material itself wasn't that good, which was my problem, and the book did not seem to correlate with his lectures.  I read maybe one or two chapters in the book before I gave up and just started to rely on his lecture notes. That said, if you attend class and study what he gives you with notes and practice midterm/tests, you should be able to do fine.

The tests are brutal and the problem sets/practice problems are time-consuming, but Dupas knows that everyone tries and really does make an effort to make sure students understand the material. My one piece of advice is to start the problem sets and exam prep EARLY, and to go in and visit Dupas if you're having problems.   And do take Math 8/11 beforehand, you'll thank yourself for it about a half hour into the first lecture.

She moves slides rapidly, and talks rapidly. I suggest reading the book before you go to class. But then the book is a pain to read; it'll put you to sleep really fast. I'm kind of ambivalent toward the prof. She's really nice and really enthusiastic, but the presentation style of her lectures are a bit confusing. It is not linear and she skips across dozens of slides at a time. My suggestion? ask her to give you the powerpoints beforehand.
@

People say Dupas and Microeconomics is hard. So it is, but it's worth it. The course does use math, but Prof. Dupas doesn't mind mathematical errors and we don't use calculators.  Prof. Dupas is a really good lecturer, keeping things interesting and giving breaks (2A) when she senses the class is getting tired. She throws in problems within the lecture so we can understand how to solve them before trying the problem sets.  The textbook may be dry, but it is good in teaching/reinforcing theory, and the problem sets are really helpful. They are collected based on a coin flip the next class, and Dupas always reviews the homework that day as well.  I didn't use the exercise workbook because all the practice needed was provided in the problem sets and extra problems she puts on blackboard. However, if you want the reassurance of having the exercise book, then by all means.
@

it's required for econ majors, so just get it over with.  Dupas is a great teacher and gives interesting lectures, but doesn't always seem to cover enough so that you completely understand how to do the problem sets
@
Pascaline Dupas
/course/864
That is why you should take this class. I mean, if you're reading this, that means there's a good chance you're a major.   Dupas is great, but mainly because she's French, energetic, and hilarious. However, her lectures could use improvement, and I would expect them to, as she's relatively new. The first exam was way to easy, but the second and final exams were BRUTAL. This really is a math class, not too complex, but there are many (too many? maybe) concepts to take in. I guess on the surface level, the ideas are pretty interesting, but once you start using them with arbitrary numbers and figures, the class loses it's appeal.
@
Pascaline Dupas
/course/864
The professor is great, she is funny, pretty, AND smart. Also, her exam/homework questions are very interesting, and very well-worded - there is very rarely confusion as to what the question is asking.  Exams are pretty challenging, long, but not as hard as the review problems she puts up, which are often impossible.  Problem sets are due each class, but are not harshly graded - it doesn't matter if you did it right as long as you did it, so there isn't too much work involved with that.  Be careful with that class though, if you don't like math - especially this prof is very math heavy, and if you're not comfortable with partial derivatives, maximizing functions etc, you probably should take math 8 or 13 prior to takin econ 21 (even though the orc describes the prereq to be Math 003, which is absurd).

This was Professor Dupas' first time teaching this course.  I don't know how her style and method diverged from other professors, but I found the class to be extremely calculus based.  It was almost a math class.  Problem sets took hours, involved a lot of calculus and torturous algebra, and you were lucky to get a few right.  The midterm and final were devastatingly hard.  Be sure you have a very solid calculus background before you take this course.  The pre-requisite is Math 3, but I don't even think that was adequate.  Consider taking Math 8 even.  Professor Dupas was incredibly nice, helpful, and her lectures were very effective.  I'm just not sure the exams were a good representation of what you learned, and that the calculus emphasis of this class is representative of the econ department as a whole.
@
Pascaline Dupas
/course/864
Her problem sets didn't reflect the material taught in class. The final was horrible. Everyone within the class took the full three hours - the sign of a poorly written test (when it comes to a basic class like this). It was cumlulative but 75% of the material came from BEFORE the midterm. Of that 75%, we had seen about 33% of those types of problems before. The material that we went over in class never got translated to the problem sets and the material that we learned through problem sets (more slowly b/c it was never taught in class) barely made its way into the final. Fear Dupas.

Do the homework.  You can get away w/ not doing so, but it would've been very helpful had I.  Also, the tests are fiendishly difficult, but curved, so when you encounter questions you have a lot of doubt in, just answer it, b/c much of the test is like that they are so hard.
@
Pascaline Dupas
/course/864
The homew work, which was due for every class, took hours and was really math intensive and didn't help you learn econ. The tests we're made up of less math intensive, more reasonable questions. Dupas sometime seemed unprepared to answer our questions about the homework when we went over it in class. The text book is largely completly useless, it has no examples in it, and nothing that could possibly help with the homework. All this said, it wasnt a terrible class, and I kind of enjoyed using calculus for something outside of a math class.
@
Pascaline Dupas
/course/864
This class was pretty mediocre.  It had a lot of math, you'd probably want to take math 8 before you take the class, although it is mostly just manipulation of numbers/variables.  The problem sets were annoying, I usually didn't get more than half of the questions right, although they were only graded on whether or not they had been completed.  The problem sets and the exams didn't seem to quite match up with the book, probably because the questions were almost all math.  The tests were really long, although they weren't really too hard.  It was just hard to answer them all in the time given.  Nobody passed in the final until the three hours were up.  Dupas was okay, she tried hard but her accent was annoying at times.
@
Pascaline Dupas
/course/864
Like the other reviewer, I don't really know what the class was supposed to be focused on, but the tests and homework required a lot of math thinking. The textbook was mostly conceptual stuff, so it was largely useless by itself. However, if you read the textbook in addition to knowing the math, I think it was much better for understanding of why the math worked. I liked the course and did well, but I also like math.
@

/course/864
Professor Dupas is a clear lecturer and obviously put a lot of time and effort into this course. That said, her expectations of what her students should be able to do were way too high! As others have said, the course is extremely heavy on math; math 8 is practically necessary. Homework was assigned for every class (you'd never know if it was going to be collected)â€“ each assignment consisted of pages of algebraic manipulation with almost no conceptual content. These assignments would take hours to complete. Grading was based on a midterm and a final. The midterm was 25 pages long, and the final 35 pages. Around a quarter of the class dropped after the midterm. I generally do very well in Econ classes, and I ended up doing well in this one. However, doing so nearly killed me.
@

This was one of the most stressful classes I've taken.  The homework and exams were unnecessarily long and difficult for the material, often requiring a full page of manipulating several algebraic variables to solve even the basic problems.

The other reviews for this class overwhelmingly suggest that Dupas is tough or bad.  Although she is certainly hard, she is unbelievably fair about points and credit.  Her lectures are interesting although a little disjointed from homework.  But if you can just get through the homework (once per week), you'll be more than prepared for the exams.  Dupas is extremely bright (she'll do the calculations in her head long before you've finished a question), funny (she has a great sense of humor), and an extremely good professor.  She explains concepts clearly although it is important that you understand everything because the class moves quickly.  All in all, this is an extremely worthwhile class that is very helpful in understanding further economic concepts.  And take it with Dupas - she'll make your life a lot easier

The subject matter is pretty straightforward, but the tests and problem sets make this class SO painful. Dupas makes her tests about 5 pages too long, so that  none but the one crazy person in the class manages to finish. BUT, I'm pretty sure this is true about all the teachers that teach this class, and atleast Dupas was upfront about it. She told us outright on the first class that this was going to be difficult, that her tests we hard, and that problem sets  were very timeconsuming. Take it if you have to. If not, steer clear.

Professor Dupas is really tough. She gives a lot of work, and the exams are long and tough (don't expect to finish).  That being said, she's great. She's always well prepared for class, and does everything possible to get people to succeed. She's funny and nice even if the class/material are tough.
@

The lectures were completely different from the problem sets, makingit very difficult to actually do them.  Because of this, most of each class was spent just going over the problem sets.  You are graded for the problem sets just by attempting them though - not by getting the right answer.  The book is completely different as well, and was totally useless. Dupas even told us that she discouraged use of the book since it was confusing.  Finally, her English is a little rough around the edges.  I've had plenty of profs before who have thick accents, but at least they understand the language.  With Dupas, this is not quite the case.  I was very, very frustrated by this class, because my grade will not match the effort I put into this class. The cards are stacked against you if you take it with Dupas.  Be warned.

Dupas makes the "dry" microecon class not only bearable, but quite interesting. Her problem sets really force you to understand the material rather than just plug and chug equations. She usually supplements each new concept with a creative example that really helped me grasp the material and her quirky sense of humor kept me engaged during class. Outside of class, she is very accessible both on blitz and by office hours. She is ready to go out of her way to make sure that you really understand the material. The marathon tests are hard and time consuming. They will keep you there the whole time, but the class is scaled in the end.
@
Pascaline Dupas

Dupas knows her stuff and works hard to give effective lectures, but one frustrating thing that happpened in our class is that a few kids would try to argue with her all the time about little things on the slides or whatever-- and that really threw her off her lectures. Other than that, she's very understanding, and is really more interested in your effort and economic reasoning than if you can get the right numbers. That being said, all of the tests are just long, multiple-part math questions (which I liked). She's a very interesting professor, you should get to know her outside of class because what she's done with developmental economics is fascinating.

just be prepared to work a lot for this course and prof dupas makes it clear that only the ones who work hard will survive in the end - which is actually true b/c by the midterm some 30 ppl dropped the class. but prof dupas is AMAZING. she is super nice and always willing to help you, and a GREAT lecturer
@
Pascaline Dupas
/course/864
Painful to sit through at times.  This class is not fun just because the material is very dry and dull.  Dupas is a great person and very willing to adapt to make her lectures more effective.  Going to her office hours is very helpful.  She's a good prof.  That being said, her tests are marathons.  25 pages+, expect to use as much time as given to take them.  You won't have time to go over things.  There's a problem set due every class, which is really annoying.  But it's not always corrected and is graded on effort not veracity.  You can probably find another prof who is an easier grader (as many Econ majors tend to do), but I would say to bite the bullet and take the class whenever you can.  Micro sucks and there's not much you can do about it.
@
Pascaline Dupas
/course/864
Problem sets could have been easier and still teach the same material for the test though Dupas explains why they are so hard in trite economic terms.   I never spent that much time on doing the problem sets, she provides solutions after they are due and you can learn them pretty well from that as long as you replicate the problem from the solutions.  Funny prof though. Her accent is cool and sometimes she says funny things without realizing.
@
Pascaline Dupas
/course/864
This was a quick-paced, math-based Econ class where you have to extend what you learn in lectures to challenging problem sets.  The exams are difficult and LONG...don't expect to finish the midterm (the final was a little better with time, but also harder).  At least Prof. Dupas recognizes the difficulty level of her course and (hopefully) adjusts grades accordingly.  That being said, you will have to spend a good amount of time learning the material and more applying it to tests/problem sets.    The course goes fast- we covered consumer theory, producer theory, imperfect competition, and asymmetric information, each with multiple subcategories.  If you are willing to put in the time, you'll probably get a lot out of this exercise in rigorous economics.  If you're lazy, don't bother.  Dupas is a so-so lecturer.  She can be humorous and engaging at times, but tended to run through her PowerPoint slides way too fast, without giving us a chance to read them.  Also, THE most annoying part of the class was when she and one or two students would get into these esoteric discussions about random hypothetical situations that would proceed for like 10 minutes, while the rest of the class looked on dazed and confused (or tuned out).  Maybe this was just our class, but it depends on how many geniuses are in your class.

Prof. Doyle is really nice! This class can be really tricky for people who aren't great at math. She gives out a hard bell curve, so if you study you won't fail. But it is really hard to get an A. I would highly recommend taking this class with Doyle! You have to attend, but she makes lectures worthwhile. Problem sets are the only material you have to study for the exams, so that can be tough too.
@
Maura Doyle
/course/864
This class is definitely a hard class. You are graded on 2 out of 3 mid-terms (you can drop the lowest grade), a final, and a 5-page paper on what we have covered up to around week 6. The mid-terms are given in such short intervals, which makes it feel like you have no time to study so you should definitely stay on top of the course. The mid-terms were pretty hard for me because they are quite different from the problem sets in my opinion. The quizzes had class averages between 82-84 though there are always people who get almost 100s. Professor Doyle does a fair job teaching us the material. She is very friendly and has an approachable personality. However, she could sometimes prolong her explanations on concepts and could sometimes be annoying. Overall, I learned a lot from the class.
@
Maura Doyle
/course/864
The content is somewhat dry because it is all the mathematical/conceptual aspects of micro. you glossed over in ECON 1/AP Micro. without many of the real-world applications. That being said, Prof. Doyle is organized, clear, and very available in terms of office hours. She also very clearly knows her stuff, and is happy to explain it to you, though you should come to office hours with real questions (not just to chat). While neither the course nor the professor were particularly inspiring, reading the textbook, completing the problem sets, and reviewing lecture material were effective both in getting a good grade and understanding the underpinnings of micro. before moving on in the econ track. Grading can be somewhat frustrating because the econ dept. forces a B test median, though you have the chance to pad your grade a bit and have some fun in the paper Prof. Doyle assigns, which allows you to examine any aspect of Dartmouth life with economic reasoning, and which everyone seemed to have a good time with. Overall, the course is about what you'd expect, but if you put in the time it's really not too hard to do well.
@
Maura Doyle

Just read the textbook and do the practice problems, and you're guaranteed to do well. Not a bad class at all—just make sure you keep up with the work and really understand her explanations. She offers so many office hours and tons of out-of-class assistance, so take advantage of them if you have anything you're not 100% sure about.

Course This is not a very interesting course, but you have to take it so just deal with it.   Professor Professor Doyle is great and really makes the material more interesting. She is really rooting for everyone to do well, and is always available outside class.  Workload Not too much work. Homeworks are optional but helpful. There are 3 midterms, but you get to drop one which is awesome.

Doyle is a very nice woman, and I thought she was a great prof.  She explained everything very well in class, and made herself very available for office hours, especially right before tests.  There are 4 midterms, and you get to drop your lowest grade, so that is great.    Make sure you do the problem sets that she gives out, because sometimes the tests had questions directly from them.  Overall, surprisingly easy and I thought it was a good class!
@
Maura Doyle
/course/864
You're graded on your quiz scores (best 3 out of 4), a short paper and the final. The problem sets take a long time but really help you prepare for the quizzes. The paper is also pretty fun to write. Prof. Doyle is incredibly nice and approachable so do take Econ 21 with her if you don't want to be too stressed out.
@
Maura Doyle
/course/864
The material is easy. The prof is amazing. But you need to work your butt off, especially if you're not good at math. That applies to micro in general. Take 21 with Doyle if you can. She's great. Very nice, gives free coffee beans to keep you awake, and holds marathon office hours/review sessions for every quiz and final.  My only complaint would be that the scheduling of four quizzes during the term makes for a lot of stress, especially if all your other classes also use the quiz format (as was the case with me). I couldn't focus on 21 as much as I wanted and needed to, so I got a grade I wasn't happy with. Nevertheless, I would do it all over again if I had to. Take with Doyle!
@

This class was just a mathy econ 1. It's definitely tough and takes some work to understand. But I can't imagine a professor doing a better job than Maura did at teaching it all. She holds an incredible number of office hours and really wants everyone to understand and do well. If you need help she gives you every opportunity to get it. She is also really nice, invites you to her house, tells stories about her friends, talks about her jobs at the Fed using micro, and is generally awesome. With the four quiz system she uses there is huge incentive to keep up with her lectures. I definitely recommend this class and this professor.
@
Maura Doyle
/course/864
Hope you remember your basic calculus!  Well, derivatives are all you'll really need...  Econ 21 is the big bad math version of Econ 1, basically.  You'll be seeing all the same graphs and going through all the same concepts, except now you'll learn why everything works the way it does on a mathematical level.  The class has no regular homework, 4 quizzes, 1 paper, a midterm and a final.  The quiz system is great because you only have to focus on 5 lectures' worth of material for each one, and the paper seems like an easy grade-booster.  Optional problem sets are distributed which you'll want to do if you care about your grades on the quizzes.  Otherwise there's little work.  The material starts out slow and easy.  If you know how to take a derivative you'll probably be scoffing at how easy the class is at the start.  It doesn't stay easy.  As the weeks go by more and more material piles up; you'll have to know tons of equations, formulas, and graphs.  Exams are fair, but considering that each has only 4-5 multi-part questions, if you forget one topic/concept, you're screwed.    Doyle is unintimidating, energetic, and friendly, but I feel that she underestimates students (by spending tons of time on relatively simple concepts) but then skips quickly through more difficult material.  Elaborate problems like the type seen on exams are rarely if ever done in class, which is what I would say is the biggetst flaw in her lectures.  Otherwise, she's very approachable and the class is small enough that she will get to know you on a relatively personal level.  In short, it's the math side of micro.  Gets relatively difficult but that's nothing that a few cram sessions won't take care of.  Prof is effective and good-natured.

If you're an econ major, you're going to have to take Micro. Take it with Professor Doyle. She's really nice, available outside of class, reasonable, and a good professor.   She really tries hard to keep the class engaged (which is hard at 845 in the morning) and her lectures are pretty effective at the conceptual stuff.   The tests are generally fair-- make sure you know how to do the problem sets, and you should do fine. People seem to say that this class is one of the harder ones in the major, but it really isn't too bad (unless you have major problems with the math, but it really isn't that hard and she reviews all the math you'll need at the beginning of the course).  Overall, Professor Doyle is a great professor and I would highly recommend taking Micro with her.
@
Maura Doyle
/course/864
About the material If you find this course burdensome, think again about being an econ major. (There is no point in taking this class if you are not a major.) 21 explains the basics of micro-economic theory, something that every respectable economist should have mastered. If you don't really like 21, and are taking this course to get an econ degree because you think it'll get you into business, you are wrong. You will not learn anything in this course that would help you do well in business or finance, and you are wasting an opportunity to major in something you are more interested in (none of the other majors will help you directly in your finance career either).   About the teacher Prof. Doyle is helpful and very clear about what she expects. She sometimes spends the first 10 minutes of the lecture talking about something totally irrelevant, but she always finishes on time with everything covered. She is a fair grader and wants you to do well, the ideal teacher for this course.  There were four quizzes, one of them can be dropped, and a final paper. There is also a final project. Go to all lectures, buy the book, and you'll do fine.

It's just every single Econ 1 topic (every single one!) but in depth, and with partial derivatives.  Expect to take partial derivatives on every other problem.  Anyways, Dear Maura is wonderful.  She gives good lectures, she works very hard to grade fairly, and she gives more office hours than you could go to if you tried.  But... be warned that there is more to the exams than the book readings.  She mentioned that in the beginning of the course, but so does every other prof, and it's never true.  A few other people and I were screwed up by the fact that there is material on the quizzes that is not in the textbook.  So, go to lectures, and actually take notes, even if you've never had to before at Dartmouth.

Micro is less interesting than Macro, but it gets tough to stay interested in Macro when you suck at it.  Micro, on the other hand, is easier and more generic.  It's a lot of learning procedures for things and keeping a few things memorized.  That pretty much gives you 70% on an exam.    Prof. Doyle is pretty good at teaching Micro and is always available outside of class.  She's also pretty lenient.  The class sacrifices some econ interest for giving a slight break for students (aka it's not as interesting as Macro, but it's easier)  Also, Prof. Doyle's idea of scrapping one midterm and making a term paper instead was pretty good.  If you get into your topic, it can get really interesting and you can learn a lot about game theory, or utility maximization, or whatever you're doing.  Takes some time but definitely worth the effort.  Gets you used to technical writing also.

From what I hear of other sections of Econ 21, I'm very glad I was in this one.  Chandan's sections move at a humane pace, and he's a personable guy who moves with you through the material.  He probably won't teach too many more terms here, so if you need to take 21, get him while you can.  The course?  Eh, not really my style, but the experience would have been a lot worse, as a whole, if someone more hard-assed were teaching it.

Microeconomics is a very interesting course. Anyone with a genuine interest in the subject will enjoy it. Take note of one thing though this course is very, very math-oriented.

@

Overall this class isn't exceptionally interesting (although it's not too boring either).  The material is pretty similar to ECON 1, although it involves much heavier use of math and calculus and you're expected to solve much more diverse and complicated problems as a result.  Professor Chandan is a good guy - he's personable almost to a fault, and really wants to make sure that every person in the class understands the material.  He's receptive to questions and doesn't mind having to explain a concept twice.  There were three problem sets (15% of grade), one midterm (35%), and a final (50%).  The questions are all very fair - not excessively hard, but you need to know what you're doing in order to get them right.  If you're a major or minor, you need to take this class.  If you're not, I don't really see why you'd want to take this class, as ECON 1 would suffice for getting your feet wet in microeconomics.

Taking econ 21 w/ Bar-Ilan is definitely not for the weak at heart and I'd say the enrollment was nearly cut in half by the end of the term.  The course material is definitely hard to begin w/ but I think that this prof makes it as hard as anyone could.  He's an ok lecturer but he's not clear all the time.  He is very readily available outside of class to help if you have the guts to visit him during office hours (its definitely worth it if you do and he is very helpful in that setting!)..It is possible to do well in the course but you will have to put in more time and effort than you have in a lot of other econ courses.  Overall i'd say its a tough class w/ a tough prof that you really have to take initiative to do  well in, if you do do that however you should be fine.
@

the material is pretty much the same as econ 1 plus some partial derivatives.  prof. bar-ilan is not at all effective in making it seem interesting.  the classes and review sessions make you feel like the tests will be fairly straight forward, and then he slaps you with the most obscure example he can find.  not a pleasant experience.
@
Avner Bar-Ilan
/course/864
Overall I would say that this was a fairly difficult class.  One thing to keep in mind is that Professor Bar-Ilan is Israeli and pretty difficult to understand.  This course is all problems, so the best way to study is to do the assigned problems.  The reading was not necessary, except for the explanations on how to do problems and vocab words, but was kind of interesting.  I would reccomend going to class, because the exams are all problems from the book and class.  However, the class examples are hard to follow because he skips steps and does not show where he derives everything.  It is important to ask where he gets formulas, even at the risk of sounding like a dumbass.  Some required problem sets would have helped as well.  However, there are only three exams, no other grades, so you can slack off pretty good.  All-in-all a decent class.

If you're an econ major you have to take this course.  It's not the most interesting material, but it's not terrible either.  Mostly it's just Econ 1 topics, but more involved.  I wouldn't recommend taking this course if you're not a major.  Prof Bar-Ilan is easy enough to understand once you get past his accent.  If you answer questions in class and don't give exactly the right response, usually he will ask someone else, who will say about what you did in a different way and he will consider that person correct.  Just don't let it discourage you.  And do the workbook excercises and readings before class, it helps a lot.
@
Avner Bar-Ilan
/course/864
There's no getting around the fact that the course material in Micro is heavily mathematical and not all that interesting in the abstract.  There are maybe eight or ten fairly simple conclusions in the entire class, and the rest is somewhat-thorny math.  Given the nature of the course, Bar-Ilan was a good prof.  I had some trouble understanding his accent at first, but I got over it.  He spent a lot of time teaching the stuff on his exams (problems), which were admittedly difficult but pretty fairly curved.  If you want to do well, he'll bend over backwards to help you.  Econ 21 is supposedly the most-dropped class at Dartmouth, so I might not take it for fun.  But I think Bar-Ilan is the right prof to take it with.

@

/course/864
The material is valuable and interesting.  Prof Bar Ilan cares about the students and material.  But he is not an effective teacher.  A rather thick accent and language barrier meant student questions often went unanswered or misunderstood.  Often times a student would answer a question correctly, but because it wasn't worded in the format the prof was expecting, he'd say it was wrong-- which added to class confusion.  The material in the course can be difficult and Prof Bar Ilan was not a particularly effective teacher-- I felt having him as a prof made the learning experience more challenging than it might have been.  Didn't do enough examples in class.  Tests were very hard and the class typically did not do fantastically, but they were a fair assessment of the material (in hind sight).
@

People give Professor Bar-Ilan too much of a hard time for his accent. Professor Bar-Ilan is not easy to understand, but after a week or so you are totally fine with everything he says. His one flaw is that he does not answer questions well in class for the most part. Just go up to him after class or during office hours and then he will answer everything and make things clear. Review class notes and you will be fine for the exams. No mandatory homework.

This course once again was presented quite clearly and comprehensible, but the exams were much too difficult.  There were two exams and 3 workouts in this class.  The workouts were all very difficult and some of the material in the workouts was not presented in class at all!!!  The first exam was relatively easy, but the Final was so hard!!!  I think Bentz made the exam so difficult seeing how many did well on the first one.  Also, I dare not go to his office hours, since he not only belittles you, he takes a completely different personality.  He is filled with so much excitement in class, but during office hours he is the COLDEST human being in the world.  Aside from that a 10a or a 2a is just not ideal for this course, since the material is just so boring!

My impression is that this varies term by term, and the summer just didn't give him enough time.

Unfortunately, by nature of the dismal science that it is, it takes a stroke of genius to make economics exciting. Yet Andreas (whom I also had for Econ1) is an excellent teacher who at least presents a solid and clear introduction to intermediate macro. Andreas is extremely well-prepared, knowledgable, and witty at times (a must for such an inherently dry subject), and is readily available during office hours. I strongly advise that, if you plan to take Econ21, you take it with Bentz. You will, plain and simply, have the best foundation for micro offerred at Dartmouth.   Also, there is a grave misconception about microeconomics (and Andreas) that I wish to dispel there is nothing tremendously difficult about the mathematical concepts. If you've had Math8, there's nothing new here. If you've only had Math3, everything is derivative of single-variable calculus.

I heard that this was one of the more difficult econ classes especially with Prof. Bentz as the professor. I did not think that the class was that bad.

Econ 21 is a definite must for any major. There is a great amount of material taught.

This is the type of course where you can do well if you buckle down early in the term and start doing lots of practice problems. If you try to cram everything in the night before an exam, you'll have a tough time.  Prof. Sessions was an interesting lecturer, but he barely assigned any work at all and then gave us brutal exams that everybody was unprepared for.  His grading policy was ludicrous. I don't even want to get into it.  Again, do a lot of practice problems from the book and you'll be fine.

This is how the class went for me  I took the first midterm after doing a fair bit of studying.  I left the midterm crushed, thinking I'd bombed the test.  I was relieved to find out a week later that everyone else bombed the test also, and my 45% was actually the median, which Professor Sessions then told us would be a B+/A-.  Okay, I thought.  This isn't too bad.  Second midterm rolls around.  I start freaking out, because stuff isn't making sense and I have little in my notes other than pages and pages of math with no explanations.  Well, Professor Sessions tells us that the highest of the two midterms can count for our entire midterm grade (60% of the final grade, originally 30% each).  Oh yeah, and it's a take home, so half the class is probably going to cheat.  Well, I opt to not take the second midterm and just use my grade from the first midterm to carry me to the final.  I figure I'll go into it with a B+/A- and hope I break the median and push myself into A- range.  WELL.  Professor Sessions then hits us with the bombshell that the final is optional and we can use our highest midterm grade as our final grade.  It can only help us if we choose to take it, etc. etc.  He then tells us that he'll send home a sheet with our current standing ASAP so we can decide if we want to take it.  Confused by this, since there are now two midterms and two groups of kids (half the class each time) who has a grade above the median, I ask him if the B+/A- dividing line would be at the median on either of the two tests.  He says yes.  Then he says the median has fallen on the first midterm after people dropped the class.  I figure I'm now above the median sitting with a comfortable A-.  No final for me, right?  Well he finally gets around to sending out everyone's current standing at around 2 PM the day before the 8 AM midterm.  A-?  Nope, C+.  Say what?  I freak out.  He didn't see this coming?  I specifically brought up in class that there were now too many kids with grades above the median, and if he was going to do a normal bell curve again, the new 'median' would be a grade above one of the two medians on one of the two midterms.  He doesn't respond to blitzes, everyone is freaking out.  I wasn't planning on taking the final and hadn't studied at all.  I start cramming and show up the next morning on no sleep.  Everyone complains that they've been deceived and he agrees to rework the distribution.  Lovely, but why couldn't he have done this the night before and admitted his mistake before I killed myself preparing for a test I never intended to take?    A roller coaster of a class due to a communication breakdown between the students and the teacher.  Not entirely his fault--apparently the British system of grading is very different from the American one.  Still, he should have recognized that and sorted this out before the morning of the final.   Whatever, I'm somewhat happy and ready to move on.

Sessions didn't teach us the material all that well.  The lectures were often times only tangentially related to what we were expected to know for the tests.  He's a really nice professor, and he's also quite the funny dude.  But when you spend several entire classes on Lagrange Multipliers, only to have basically none of that stuff appear on your first midterm - that should tell you something about your teaching.  The biggest complaint was the prof's grading.  He was very good about listening to people, and working to make sure that everything was right, but I found it kind of odd that he initially had a bell-curve scheme in his grading - with a lot of people getting C's and even D's (which are basically unheard of here).  He supposedly fixed that though.  I really want to say that Sessions was a great professor, since he was a pretty funny guy, and an all around cool British dude.  However, there was something about his lecture style such that the material didn't really *click* with me in time for the exams.  I had to teach myself most of the stuff from the book.  Sessions can definitely work on his lecturing - making it more relevant and effective so that his course/test goals are clearer.  He's a cool guy though.

Sessions is a hilarious English guy who doesn't take the world too seriously, which is nice when you're dealing with the often-dry material of microeconomics.  He is a lot of fun to listen to in class.  However, he is average when it comes to lecturing.  He understands that most people zone out after too much math-based producer theory, so he does a good job of breaking up the monotany in class.  Overal, he's a fun guy, but not the greatest econ teacher on the planet.  His grading system is seriously messed up, though.  His course assessment consisted of an in-class mid-term, a take-home mid-term, and an optional final.  The original plan was to value each mid-term at 30% and the final at 40%.  However, he decided to get fancy and made it so that your grade is EITHER the highest of your two mid-term scores relative to the median OR the highest of your two mid-term scores relative to the median (60%) plus your optional final score relative to the median (40%).    This system drastically favors people who did extremely well on one mid-term and failed the other.  For example, if someone got 90% on MT1 and didn't even take MT2, they would outscore someone who got 80% on both.  In my case, my highest grade was on MT2 and I didn't take the final, so my entire grade was based on an exam that only covered 3 weeks worth of the material.   Seriously fucked up.  But don't count on this helping you  I know a few people got on the wrong end of this system, and their grades show it.  Overall, solid course, funny but average prof, and wacky grading.  If you're taking it, you're probably an ECON major.  If you're not an ECON major, don't take it.  There are WAY better things out there to try.

John Sessions is a great, funny, and caring guy who does not know how to effectively teach micro (at least to American students). His lectures were filled with archaic derivations that had nothing to do with the homeworks, which in turn had nothing to do with the exams.  Exam medians of 43 and 69 (on a take-home!) demonstrate how horrendous the exams were.  One of the most stressful and awful classes I've ever taken at Dartmouth....which is a shame, because Professor Sessions really is such a great guy.  Take 21 with someone else.

DO NOT TAKE 21 WITH THIS MAN  he was a visiting prof and his tests were impossible and his teaching was confusing and there was an optional final but he didn't tell you until the day before the final whether or not you needed to take it!!!   it was just psychological and emotional hell

Fun Stuff
@
Eric Edmonds
/course/864
The class on its own isn't terrible, although it is challenging because it is very calculus-based. But, with Edmonds, I found the class to be very difficult because of the way it was taught. He clearly knows his stuff, but he goes through the material so quickly and often only focuses on one problem for most of the class, that it is hard to really understand the concepts. The problem sets (which were daily) were challenging but helpful, but the exams were very different from the problem sets making them almost impossible to prepare for. The class is pretty dry in general, but I think it could be a much less frustrating experience with a different professor.
@
Eric Edmonds
/course/864
Edmonds got tenured during our term, and he's a development econometrician.  The administration must have made a mistake or something, because he didn't seem to like microeconomics.  Since he won't teach Econ 21 again, I'll just make a couple notes about the professor  1) He mocks people relentlessly.  If you're sensitive or don't find it amusing, just avoid him.  2) He thinks you're smarter than you are.  Edmonds is a bright fellow, and he'll leave you in the dust if you don't slow him down when you don't understand a concept.  3) He knows his material well.  If you survive the first two conditions, he's a good professor to LEARN from.  Also, he used questions from his old finals to create the final for our class, which made it ridiculously easy.  The midterm was hell.  Just a warning.

I thought Econ 1 was horrible, but 21 was much better....related more to real world but mainly a application of econ 1.....explained all that stuff in 1 to me....i thought it would take a lot of work but didnt do much but tests and homeworks very reasonable so grades are good.....highly recommend teacher mainly because he was laid back and didnt force busy work on you
@
Eric Edmonds
/course/864
Remember  when he says "The tests are going to be straight out of the problem sets" he's not telling the truth. you have been warned. His tests are difficult, and he kills any interest.  He had only 2 hours of office hours every week. And, he was gone for the last week and the 1st two weeks--if you calculate that out on paper, thats a lot of money wasted.  if you're a major you have to take this course. Well. 'Nuff said.

/course/864
From what I had heard about Micro, it was calculus heavy.  Not true with this professor.  The mat was oversimplified and I am actually worried that I will be in trouble for later classes.    With that said, the professor is nice, she worries too much about her students but her worries were well founded, she decided to do the "teaching" style tests so material we didn't cover was often the focus of a long essay question.   Everything was written on the board and the textbook was not only terrible, but also never used.  Nevertheless, if you are reasonably good at Economics it isn't that difficult of a class and definitely did not include that much math.

prof mcgarry's class was organized like a high school course.   you didn't have to know anything that wasn't present in her lecture notes for her exams and ps. also, the material itself was a more in-depth repeat of intro micro. hence, it was pretty easy compared to other econ courses.
@
Francesco Passarelli
/course/864
The course itself is interesting, but for the love of God, don't take it with Passarelli. He is not a good prof, grading is really harsh, and progress throughout the course does not really matter. If you screw up the midterm, you're screwed for ever... Hopefully he won't be here too often, try to avoid him!
@
Francesco Passarelli
/course/864
The main thing is that Passarelli was just here for one term and is going back to Italy. The common denominator no matter what is the textbook by Hal Varian. It is eminently clear and understandable, so whoever you take 21 with, read the textbook thoroughly and try to get a feel for what the professor's exams will be like.
@
Francesco Passarelli
/course/864
55% of the grade depends on the final, which is an absurd amount.  if the thought of 1 bombed test ruining your grade without you even having a chance to drop the class or do anything about it scares you, then be careful
@
Francesco Passarelli
/course/864
The entire grade is mainly based on two tests - the midterm and final.  There is no margin for error if you are off on one of those days.  The other problem is that the tests do not adaquately test all the material in class and so if you miss one subject and the test happens to be on that one subject, you're out of luck.  In class, Passarelli can be a stimulating teacher when he relates all his stories from Italy to the subject matter.  This class can be a breeze since Passarelli assigns virtually no homework.
@
Francesco Passarelli
/course/864
Passarelli is the worst prof I've ever had, in the econ department at least. He didn't know his stuff very well. He'd make lame jokes about how bad a prof he was, and about the Dirty Boy Cafe on Main St. Avoid exchange profs, unless you know they have a good reputation.

@
Erzo Luttmer
/course/864
Don't take this class with Luttmer. Don't get me wrong, Luttmer is friendly, energetic, and approachable. He's also slightly awkward. The class itself is not at all worth it. You need a 92% to get an A-. Yes, that means a 91% will get you a B+. Moreover, you need a 96% for an A. Considering the final is 40% of your grade, if you miss a chunk of a short answer question, you can't mathematically get an A anymore. Luttmer doesn't give any practice finals, and makes you pay for MyEconLab, which is utterly useless busy work online. He just goes over practice problems in class, and then expects you to come out of class with an expert intuition of microeconomics. He explains topics in a simplistic way, expecting those inadequate explanations to impart magical economic intuition in our minds, but that's definitely not how it works. Perhaps he'll try and actually lecture in the future. Take it with someone else
@
Erzo Luttmer
/course/864
Econ 21 with Prof Luttmer was wonderful. You read the textbook and take notes outside of class; during class time Luttmer explained more difficult concepts and led practice problems. Each class began with a verbal pop quiz that counted toward participation. Luttmer highly values participation and expected everyone to volunteer to answer at least once per class. There were four quizzes throughout the term on every other Friday that were one part short answer (definitions) and two parts long answer (math problems). The final was the length of two quizzes. Luttmer was friendly, energetic and eager to help anyone who needed it. Make sure you do the reading and show up to class prepared--he can tell if you don't and will call you out. Luttmer gives tons of practice quizzes that prepare you very well for the actual quiz--if you know the material on the practice quizzes you're pretty much set for the real deal.

Professor Swartzstein is a new teacher and he's a pretty uninspiring lecture. He's a very nice guy and you can tell that he's trying, but most of his lectures are just him reading some dull slides.

Awful prof  Workload Decent, assigned 9 problem sets total, 3 quizzes, 2 midterms, and a final.  You had something just about every week, but if you enjoy econ then it's a good classs
@
Fahri Ulusoy
/course/864
Course It's one of those classes you just have to get through.   Professor Professor Ulusoy isn't super organized. He doesn't plan in the syllabus when each topic will be covered, so toward the end of the course, he was rushing to try and cover as much material as possible. He's still working on his PhD and is new to Dartmouth, so I don't think he has a ton of teaching experience. His office hours are kind of sporadic (he usually announces when they will be less than 24 hours before he holds them), but he definitely makes himself available if you can't make it. He is pretty helpful in office hours though--he's happy to go over anything you didn't understand.  Workload Professor Ulusoy assigned a lot of problem sets (there was at least one every week and they were usually pretty long), but they weren't graded. Quizzes were easy, but exams were pretty hard. A lot of people, myself included, felt that the multiple choice questions on the exams were very difficult.

Professor Simons is not bad. The tests were pretty variable. The first one was pretty easy, the second one had a class mean of 57 or something.

The material presented in class didn't seem too extreme, but then the tests were insanely hard. I would do fine with most of the homework assignments, but then bombed the tests.

Course Snyder tries to discuss every topic like it's profound. So what is YOUR example on a positive externality? What is YOUR example on a tragedy of the commons type problem? Cold-calling gets really annoying/intimidating also. He doesn't lecture almost at all.  Professor Professor is smart but puts on a front by saying he worked on a textbook problem for an hour trying to use the chain rule or something. Sometimes it's hard to know whether he knows his sh*t. He doesn't have the best reputation of being good during office hours. He can be pretty humble though-- tries to respect students' opinions.  Workload Do the problem sets I guess.  All the exam material is from problem sets or lecture notes.

/course/864
Professor Snyder is one of the best professors I've had at Dartmouth. He is extremely knowledgeable (he wrote the textbook!) and is an extremely clear and organized lecturer. He genuinely cares about his students he made himself available outside of class, held office hours the whole day before our final exam and he and his wife (Professor Doyle, who taught the other section) invited all of their students over for dessert.   I felt that he really pushed us to make the most of our academic experiences.  He really appreciate curiosity (if you ask him a stimulating question that goes beyond the scope of what you're learning, he'll make time to give you a great answer). There was a term paper in which we had to use the tools we had learned in the course to model an economic problem relevant to a student's academic life. I did mine on something that we hadn't really covered in class, but he really supported me throughout.  Last words of advice micro is a math class! I have no idea why it fulfills the SOC distrib. The first one or two weeks may be a bit scary for those who haven't done math in a really long time - you learn about partial derivatives and Lagrangians and other intimidating things but once you grasp it, the course gets a lot easier.   Professor Snyder is great - take micro with him if you can!

Super interesting topics. A bit of math, not too bad. Russell is the MOST organized person you will ever meet. She provides a ton of review material. If you do all of it, you'll do well in the class.

Course *** Please read! ***  Professor This is pretty long, but please read because I think the information I'm giving is really helpful, and I wish I knew this stuff before I went into the class.  The professor is not that great with words. You have to sort of already know the answer beforehand in order to understand what the professor is getting at. Fortunately, though, you can go to office hours/ help hours/ T.A. hours to get extra help if you are unable to follow the lecture. Having the professor teach me individually during office hours was very helpful. During his lecture, I would not understand a concept, and he would just keep going, and since the material is cumulative, I was basically screwed. He just goes too fast during the lecture for me to follow, and he's just not great at explaining the logic of the algorithms or the purpose of each of the data structures. I think it's because he just assumes we know certain things already. That's why I would highly recommend going to his office hours to have him clarify some of the steps he sometimes skims over or just assumes we know. He is very friendly during office hours, and you don't have to worry about being bothersome to him because he is genuinely happy to help you. I'm a pretty shy person, so at first I was really uneasy about going to him for help. However, by the end of the term, I was just so desperate that I had to, and I'm really glad I did because otherwise, I'm sure I would've died on the final. If I could change one thing, it would be to go to office hours more often and not have been so reserved until it was almost too late. I had taken c.s. in high school and gotten a 5 on the AP CS A, so I sort of felt invincible going into the class and was like, "I dont' need no help," but I was absolutely wrong. Getting help early, for the tests and for the labs, is super important. Sorry I made this so long. Good luck!  Workload Sorry this is so long, but please read because I think the information I give is important.  The course is fast-paced and time-consuming, which means you should probably not take too many other work-intensive courses alongside this course. Be very wary of your time management. I was overconfident and took some really hard courses alongside this course, and I deeply regret it. Please stay on top of your homework and labs. I feel like everyone, including me, thought they could just be CLUTCHBEAST and do the labs on the second to last day or last day, but DON'T do that. Also, I always study like... one or two days before test because I am the procrastinating kind, but DON'T do that either. It is easy to fall dangerously behind very fast, because concepts are cumulative (to some extent), and it takes time to think things over and finally understand the logic of it. When I eat or walk around campus to go somewhere, I am usually thinking about the comp sci material we just learned because, for me at least, the material isn't something you can just get immediately. It takes time to figure out the logic before it finally clicks. Most people reading this are probably going to be like, "No I'm so smart. I can do anything. This reviewer is probably just some noob who isn't made for the c.s. major and should probably go do the Econ major," but I promise you I am legit (not to be arrogant). I scored really well on the final and did really well on the problem sets, and I still thought the course was super hard and that staying on top of the homework and material is super important. Just don't leave things to the last minute! Good luck!

If you're reading this, you've most likely taken CS 5 and are considering the next step. If that's the case, CS 8 won't surprise you- it's very similar in structure to CS 5. Lectures that are pretty dry (code examples don't work well in a lecture format) but the labs are fun and interesting- the Kevin Bacon game for databases, for example, and Tetris for graphics.   Haskell is very different from Java. It's going to feel very weird for a while, but you get used to it, so don't worry if it's uncomfortable for several weeks. It was interesting to see how different programming languages can be, how their strengths and weaknesses are different.  The course feels very standard. I'm not sure what it is, but there's something exciting about CS 5 that isn't there in CS 8. I've spoken to other students who feel the same way. The labs are definitely fun, though.  By the way, beware the Stock Data clustering lab- it fell at the same time as the midterm, and was the most difficult lab of the course in my opinion (since you have two weeks for Tetris.)   Also, with grading, you get practically all of the points on the programming assignments (if you finish them and they work), but the tests tend to be difficult, so it isn't necessarily a guaranteed A.

This class was a functional programming class.  While the labs were (for the most part) really cool (Tetris, Kevin Bacon Game, etc), the actual lectures were invariably boring.  you DO need to go to class he covers tons of stuff in lecture that isn't in the book, but it's not a class i really looked forward going to. If you've got solid programming skills, i'd recommend the class, but if you're not a major/minor, i wouldn't take it for an "easy third".  I spent many late hours in sudikoff, and so did many of my classmates.  In the end, i've got a love-hate relationship with the class.  even though i did learn a LOT, it was tough and time-consuming.

The classes and topic were decent, but some of the lab assignments were ridiculously hard. They were all doable, but would take 6 or 7 hours per night. However, the prof and the TAs were helpful. Also, you really don't need to buy the book. You can find everything online.

The material was definitely interesting and professor Drysdale is a very nice person. However, in the later parts of the course, I found myself dozing off in lecture because professor Drysdale often went over pieces of code in class, which was rather ineffective for me. However, I am really glad to learn about functional languages and I got to enjoy Haskell a great deal. The assignments/exams were definitely fair.

The hardest part about this course is the lab-- the problem sets and short assignment do help you to understand the material but if you are not a natural programmer expect to spend a HUGE amount of time in the labs. The TAs are not always available and many times there were many more students who needed help than there were available TAs. Expect a big time commitment

Functional Programming is quite exciting compared to the tedious Java of CS5.  The lectures for the course weren't that great. Drysdale knows a lot but he does not communicate it very effectively. However, he puts up his lecture notes on the web, so you can easily teach yourself what you missed after class.  The assignments on the other hand are a lot of fun and the way to really learn what was taught in class...
@
Robert Drysdale
/course/682
The course is really great and interesting. Functional programming is a whole new world (different from OOP stuff like Java). The syntax of the language used in the course (Haskell) is a little frustrating at first, but you come to appreciate it as time goes on. The material is really interesting, but the lectures can be a little dry sometimes. It varies day-to-day. Some are good. Some you'd rather sleep through. The problem sets, though, are a lot of fun. Among other things, you create programs to play Tetris, parse HTML, and play the six degrees of Kevin Bacon game.
@
Robert Drysdale
/course/682
The lectures during class were - at best - mediocre. Although taught with the best intentions, and by a good prof, the concepts were very difficult to explain through a lecture and the lectures were close to useless. Tangents and explanations of "bad" methods of doing things led to confusion. Luckily, the Professor  posted typed lecture notes (although not formatted), online - which were helpful to use to study for exams. See the lab section below for information on that... Unfortunately, the heavy weighting of the tests counteract all the work you put into PSs  - and the tests are not only very difficult, but also seem to have many trick questions. This course will make you reconsider many times if you really want to be a CS major. Take it only if you need it to become a major - and are sure you want to.

This class isn't too bad.  I slacked off a bit during the term so I didn't do as well as I'd liked, but all the work was pretty manageable.  Haskell is a bit weird to get used to but I liked it once I understood it better.  I hate exams in this type of class, but they're pretty much like the ones in CS5 (except there's only one midterm). The major problem I had with this class is just that Drysdale is reeeeally boring, so I almost always fell asleep in class. He posts his lecture notes online though, so teaching yourself the material really isn't that bad.

I enjoyed this course a lot.  Admittedly, I am something of a CS geek.  The programming language this class is taught in is very helpful, I've found, and my experience coding in it has made my code overall much better.  Coming from a language like Java or C, Haskell seems initially very odd, but it is incredibly powerful, as we came to realize in the course of this course.  Professor Drysdale was very accessible, and while I never took advantage of his office hours, he was very good about responding to questions emailed to him, I found.

This is the first term this particular class has been taught, so it was perhaps a little rough around the edges. The old CS-18, before my time, was taught by the now-departed Fromberger and used Scheme. This class is (at least this term) taught by Drysdale and uses Haskell. Professor Drysdale is perfectly competent and knows (and explains) the concepts of functional programming, but it's obvious he hasn't been working in Haskell for years. The problem sets were overall very reasonable, but the third one was considerably more time consuming than the others, and came as something of a shock (it was not intended to be any more difficult). Little rough edges such as these should be ironed out as the course is taught more.     I personally found Drysdale's lecture style to be a bit boring, and he would sometimes go through some examples and expansions that seemed unnecessary to me. Nonetheless, the lectures were informative, and I would highly recommend attending them. Skim the textbook to pick up a few minor points and concepts that the lectures don't cover or if you're having difficulty understanding the lecture. In general I didn't consider the text to be phenomenal or essential for most of the course.   The problem sets are for the most part very interesting applications (parsing, solving problems such as n-queens). There is a little too much emphasis on graphics for my taste, and the final project involved writing Tetris. The application of functional programming abstractions to these areas is interesting, but I think slightly impractical. Game/graphics development is one area where C/C++ still reigns supreme due to the speed concerns and purely functional languages such as Haskell become a tad ugly when doing I/O.   One place where this class really shines is in availability of the professor and TAs. There were three TAs in addition to the professor for a class of about 30, and all were very helpful. Professor Drysdale is very pleasant and always available.

It's really helpful if you already know some Java before starting this course. I relied heavily on my Java background from AP computer science in the class. The class moves really quickly, but it's manageable. Preview the material before class, review the slides after lecture, and make sure you understand the programming drill exercises and problem sets. The problem sets take so much time and are really difficult, so start them as soon as possible and stick to a good schedule. The problem sets are really frustrating and difficult, but they are also extremely rewarding at the end (when the code actually works). The TAs are helpful in general, but some didn't really know what was happening a lot of the time. Professor Pierson explains concepts well. However, the problem sets could have been explained a little bit more clearly.

I took CS1 with Cormen — no programming experience beforehand — and found it very manageable and straightforward. CS10 was double the workload & difficulty. Mainly because Pierson doesn't spoonfeed you nearly as much as Cormen does; whereas Cormen's instructions on both labs & exams were basically pseudocode, there is a lot more room for interpretation, and variability in solutions & their efficiencies, on Pierson's materials. Get used to thinking of data structures within data structures within data structures. Also, do whatever you need to do to keep up with the fast pace of this course (preview, review, ask questions, etc.). Make use of TA office hours, but maximize your time by going to the ones with the more experienced TAs. You'll figure out who they are soon enough.

This class went insanely fast. Pierson goes through roughly 120 slides per class. It was hard to absorb all the information being thrown at you. I recommend sitting on the sides with your laptop in class and following along on your computer to the slides. Sometimes he goes really slow on the concepts to make sure you understand it, but then he'll speed through the actual code parts. The labs were hard. It took a lot of hours at office hours with TAs for me to figure out the labs. Try to do labs with partners. That definitely helps. Do the practice problems before the exams, but don't fret if you can't figure them out. His exams were usually much easier than the practice problems he gave us. His final really helped boost my grade. If all else fails, remember you can NRO this class.

The concepts in the class are not hard, it's just a lot of material being thrown at you so the class is time consuming. Professor Pierson is a smart guy (not to mention cool) and his office hours are really helpful if you have specific questions. For the class,  the PPTs are very helpful ~ if you understand them back and front, that's all you need for the exams. You need to taking learning into your own hands for this class. You can't just go to class and listen. You need to know the PPTs like the back of your hand -- I studied for the exams by testing myself on whether I could write the code on the PPTs myself and it turned out to be an effective way of studying. His PPTs cover a lot of information but the tests are based on what he covers in class. If he doesn't focus on something in class, it's not likely to be tested on. There are 6 PSETs for the class, and they each take a lot of time. Each took me 12-20 hours. Start them the day they're released. Know that you have one 48 hour extension! I spent 15+ hours per week for this class, but I felt like it was very rewarding. I've come out of it proficient in Java and well acquainted with many new types of data structures.

Professor Pierson is one of most interesting professors I've had during my time at Dartmouth. Some people complain about the pace of the course and conflate its difficulty with Pierson's teaching skill, which is a flawed assumption as best. Be ready to put in work, work with a partner who works just as hard as you (which is hopefully very hard), and you'll do fine. Slack off, expect the lectures to leave you completely understanding the material, and you won't succeed. CS is not about listening, it's about doing. If you can't figure out the concepts on your own, then maybe CS as a course of study isn't for you.

The material of the class is really interesting. However, Pierson is a terrible professor, who has completely plagiarized the class from the last prof. As such, all the last profs' mistakes in assignments are still present. I love this material but almost every assignment is riddled with unclear directions, and english so bad someone from north korea could have written it. TAs are helpful. The class would be infinitely easier if it was written by someone with a coherent understanding of the english language.  Also, to do well in this class, familiarize yourself with java beforehand. ESPECIALLY java swing and awt. You won't need to write a lot of gui code / swing code, but I think that understanding these libraries will help you grasp assignments much faster and make your life much easier.

If you can take this class with Professor Jayanti, do it. He is an absolute joy. He makes lectures engaging and easy to follow. He gives good assignments and provides plenty of help. The exams are not easy, but they are fair - they cover questions similar to the ones covered in class or assignments.

Course Fast-paced and really interesting.  The concepts you learn in class and the problem sets make you think.  Professor Very enthusiastic, eager to answer questions, and explained concepts clearly.  Workload Lots of work.  Weekly problem sets and short assignments (which aren't that short sometimes). It's necessary to really get prepared for other CS courses at Dartmouth, though, so its nothing to complain about.  There are a lot of help hours for assignments.

CS10 is a huge step up from CS1. I had a relatively easy time in cs1, did well on the exams, and I thought cs10 couldn't be that much more difficult. I was mistaken. If you have time before the course, I would definitely recommend starting to learn Java syntax. It's very different from Python and the first few labs took me an unnecessarily long time just because I was so familiar with the syntax. Beyond that, the first and final exams are really difficult. Even though we were allowed to work with partners for the labs, you should do labs yourself to be better prepared for the exams. I think this class will tell you how well-equipped you are in continuing in CS, and if you struggle a decent bit, then I would recommend changing your major.

Professor Minardi is one of the greatest teachers/profs I ever had. The thing I missed the most, schoolwise, when I came to college was that public school teacher who cares for each one of her students as if they were her own. She baked a cake on someone's birthday. And she made cookies for us when we had quizzes/tests. That was professor Minardi. She did not speak a word of English during class the whole term and this helped immensely. Don't be intimidated because you will find that mostly everyone is just as confused as you during the first week. She is Italian so there are no questioning of her skills. Her tests are fairer than the Hawkeye computer that judges lines in Wimbledon. They are not difficult and if you have been going to class and drill, you will do well.   The only thing that I didn't like about this class was drill. Morning drill is about the worst invention ever.  So prepare for early nights and early mornings, Five days a week. But you will not regret it.

The course starts off nice and slow but as it picked up it was difficult for me to not confuse all of the articles, prepositions and verb conjugations. The workbook and lab manual take a long time to complete but seem like good preparation for the exams. The exams are beyond fair and don't require a lot of memorization of vocab only rules such as how to conjugate verbs. But Italian 1 has drill five days a week and until the last day of class.  Anna Minardi is amazing!!! She makes Italian fun, interesting and manageable. She works with you if you are struggling or just want to move from a B+ to an A-. She is one of the best and friendliest professors I've had.

This course was lots of fun, mainly because Anna is such a great professor. She has lots of energy (which is definitely a plus for a 9 am class) and does a great job of involving everyone. Also, my term just wouldn't have been the same without her cookies. The class isn't hard at all. I rarely had homework, and the workbook and lab manual are easy. The class does suck up a lot of time though. It met 5 days a week and drill was also 5 days a week. I did afternoon drill, which made it better, but it's still a big time commitment. It's worth it though, because the work outside of class and drill is easy (and rare)and the class is fun.

Anna's great!  She is funny, definitely inspires interest for learning Italian (she's "di Parma, in Italia"), and you definitely learn how to start speaking and thinking in Italian... somehow both the ability to translate between English and Italian and the ability to speak "without thinking" are taught.  It may have just been my high school and it may be just be the Dartmouth method, but I've learned about the same amount of Italian and more of how to speak in one term here than three years of Spanish in high school!  I'm excited about taking the next two terms, even though drill is only *slighly* annoying at 745am every day...

Prof. Fabricant makes the material as interactive as it can be.  She is really helpful outside of class, I wish I went to more of her office hours.  She really is a kind teacher and wants her students to learn.   Only French is spoken in the class, which can make it intimidating when asking questions, but she really helps you out.    Expect homework every night, but overall it helps you to learn the language better.  Good & helpful prof.

Professor Fabricant is very tough, putting people on the spot and making you feel uncomfortable like no one else can. But if you do the work and study, you will definitely learn the language. There is homework every day, which sucks and drill is so repetitive that it's tough to get the energy to get there by 745am, but in the end it seems to be the best French class. Unfortunately I felt rushed during my exams and often didn't have a chance to review my tests because she gives you a one minute warning then grabs the test. Overall, be prepared for an intense class and make sure you're prepared for class!!!

Ignore any reviews about Fieke not being great. If you take French with her, you will learn the language -- bottom line. And on top of that, you'll get an A as long as you put in the work. It was a bit of a drag to wake up at 7 am for drill everyday, but that's part of the language program here, and looking back, it helped a lot.

Pretty standard class- nothing too special. Quizzes are held once a week, and they're fairly easy. You can easily cram the night before the test and still do pretty well. Fabricant might be seen as a bit more "uptight" than other profs, which is probably why she gets lower ratings, but she's really not that bad. If you want to learn French, take it with her.   The work is pretty fair. Assignments were easy- at most, they'll take you about an hour outside of class each time class is held. When it comes to homework, it's more about time it takes you to do it than difficulty.  And yes, morning drill is pretty bad. But if you're awake, drill is a pretty good study tool. Otherwise, try getting afternoon drill.

Fabricant is a really nice lady! She gives homework every day and it's annoying but it's beneficial. She makes class interactive and fun when she can.  I had to put a lot of time into this class because I had absolutely no french background. It was a little annoying since I got the feeling that most people had taken at least a little bit in high school. She makes you talk to her during office hours if you make below an 85 on her weekly quizzes. A lot of times I felt like I didn't have quite enough time for the quizzes but whatever.

The class goes really really fast. People who have not had French before may struggle more than others. Keep up with the work and study study study for quizzes. Those make up the biggest percentage of your grade and also gauges your progress in learning the language.   Fabricant is very helpful in and outside of class, but she has a tendency to work through negative reinforcement.

Fabricant made me learn.  A lot, A lot, A lot of busy work, but it helped with the grammar and basic concepts.  For a language, I felt that we went at a very quick pace and as a person with barely any french background, it was extremely difficult.  Fabricant assigned a lot of extra work, but it seemed to help those who did not understand and it was a great aide in preparing for exams.      The class was interesting to me because it was entirely in French.  Beware of the crucial directions that are always rattled near the end of class.  Also the homework assignments were sometimes unclear. No PROB!  They were nothing too big for blitz.  )    French I with Fabricant was tough, but it was truly rewarding.  She cares!     Oh yes! Fabricant's scenarios for the drill scenario night always ROCK!

Apparently Fabricant is one of the hardest profs for French 1. I was taking it out of interest (if you don't need this, definitely audit/NRO), so I didn't have to worry about the grade too much, but it was really easy to make dumb mistakes on the tests, so be careful. It definitely moves very fast but I guess that's necessary for Dartmouth.

I was just interested in getting a good background in French (that I plan to continue to develop in French II), and this class certainly helped me achieve that. It's true waking up every morning for drill is a drag at times, but if anything it forces you to have a long day (this is good) and, well, to have three meals (I recommend egg sandwiches at Collis). Fieke (is it "Fake"? Nobody knows) is admittedly very fast-paced, but always halts when there are questions. The course, in all, does what it sets out to do. So if you want or have to take French, you could do worse than this.

the class definitely helped me learn the basics of the language, but the professor was horrible for a college-level class.  i felt like i was in middle school a lot of the time and it was really uninspiring.  but i guess i learned french decently well, so you can't knock that... unless you hate french, in which case i'm surprised you've read so far into my review.  but while i have your attention, let me tell you about myself.  i'm a sensitive guy with an edgy side to me.  i like getting my adrenaline pumping both inside and outside the classroom.  when i'm not busy failing french 1, i like to keep myself occupied by sinking saves, listening to musical styling's of cam fortin, and straight up playing women.  i can't even remember the last time i DIDN'T score with a girl.  and i have french 1 to thank for that!

THis class was required for me. I knew that learning another language was going to be hard but it didn't require the amount of suffering I endured. Prof. Fabricant was happy with nothing less than an A on all tests and quizzes. She gave us tons of work everyday and expected you to have it done for the next class. The only thing that saved me was getting a tutor and my drill instructor. If it wasn't for them I would not have passed French. French is an awesome language to learn but try to avoid Prof. Fabricant.
@
Fieke Fabricant
/course/1274
I love languages and feel that I am pretty good at them, however, this course tries to cram way too much material into one term.  Even if you study every night and memorize like a fiend, it is impossible to force your mind to absorb everything that is expected of you.  Worst of all, you cannot build on your knowledge until what preceeds the new concept is adequately learned, which is something you cannot control given the pace of this class.  Professor Fabricant, although she seems anxious to have you understand in her office hours, does not pay attention to students' questions in class and instead deems "getting through all the material" more important than rectifying doubts, which is very frustrating as a student.  Also, she gives a large amount of homework and is always trying to sniff out the person who perhaps couldn't get that particular assignment done in one night, since that's all the notice you have.  In fairness, I sincerely believe she is invested in the class and cares how her class performs, which is why as her student you feel an enormous amount of pressure.

The language classes move very quickly at Dartmouth, and French 1 is no exception.  At times, the class was frustrating and the material difficult to keep up with, but in the end when you can keep a conversation with your professor in French, the course is very self-gratifying.
@

the course is alright...but if french isn't going to be your major, avoid Fabricant.  she really isn't that bad of a person...she is just really into french.  So basically she assigns way, way, way, way too much work...and it's all pointless busy work that doesn't help enough for the time you have to spend doing it.  i do have to admit that i did learn the material well...but i could have done the same on my own without all of here extra busy work.

She's a little tougher than other French profs but if you take good notes you'll be really well prepared for the tests every week. The weekly tests really help you understand the material and Fabricant is also very helpful and will help you if you aren't doing well. The final is very very easy and short. You'll definitely learn the material if you take this class. Fabricant is great!!!

Prof. Fabricant is a good teacher.  She is usually available outside of class...but she has very limited time slots.  She's a really nice person, and wants you to learn French.  She is always willing to answer questions...except for when she's in a hurry.  Some things I didn't like about the class... 1. The amount of material.  I thought this was just French one! 2. homework---or should i say...busywork.  Tons of it.  Tons. But overall, she's a nice teacher..its an interesting language.  Average grade was an A- or something like that. But if you want something a little more spicy...take Spanish.

This class is great. The language is beautiful, and easy (especially if you know Spanish or French). Italian is fun both linguistically and culturally. Classes are actually interesting and full of energy, and the work is negligible. Exams are entirely straightforward.  Beppe is absolutely fantastic! He's a lot of fun, very energetic and funny, and he actually cares about you. He wants you to do well and enjoy yourself. He brings home-made cookies after every quiz and is just awesome. There's no way to describe it unless you take a class with him.  If you're looking to learn a great new language, or just want a very easy and practical third class, Italian 1 is perfect. Seriously.

Beppe is amazing. He's really responsive to students and makes what might otherwise be a difficult task fun and exciting. Yes, it's taught completely in Italian, which can be somewhat frustrating at first, but Beppe makes sure every person understands.

This class was a great introduction to Italian. You really do learn a lot in a short amount of time, but the class is so fun and interesting that you hardly notice the amount of work.  Beppe is absolutely amazing. He is so enthusiastic about class every single day and really loves his students. His passion really is contagious. Every lecture is extremely effective and he makes sure you are prepared for every exam. If given the chance, definitely take a class with Beppe. You will not be disappointed!

Beppe is fantastic!  While it seems that ity moves pretty fast (at least compared to high school) Beppe coaches you throughout, and makes sure you understand the material.  Then, before the quizes and exams he blitzes you the headings for the tests and some review problems.  On the tests, he even creates questions that involve situations with people in the class.  Beppe has a great personality, he is always joking and brings us his wife's cake to have on test days.  Loved the class, and I hope to have Beppe again for Italian.

I have a problem with the Rassias method. My problem is this Intro classes should not be immersion classes, they should be a combination of grammar learning in English, and phonetics, conversation, and vocabulary learning in Italian. There is no reason why we should not be able to ask questions in English. I was appalled by the level of teaching I recieved in Italian I. I was taught nothing. Instead, I was forced to stare at a professor who was speaking a language I did not understand, and write down what he wrote on the board, even if I had no idea what his point was. This made for a very, very, difficult term for me. As my drill instructor was technically "not allowed" to answer grammar questions, I had no one to ask them to. I signed up for a tutor but had no time to meet with her. I would recommend, anyone taking this class to buy the textbook a term in advance, and teach themselves the grammar, because the prof is not going to teach it to you. Beppe is a nice guy, but his version of the Rassias method is perhaps the worst teaching style I have encountered at Dartmouth. I would recommend the Russian department as a far superior department in teaching style. You are certainly immersed in the language by the professor, but you are allowed and encouraged to ask your questions in English so that you can understand the material. The grammar is explained in English so that it is understandable.  I think Italian I is only easy for those people who have a spanish or french backround. For those who have studied more difficult languages, like latin or slavic languages, and are looking for a more scholarly approach to grammar and construction, they will not get it in the Italian department.

Like all first level languages, Italian 1 was easy.  The tests and homework were all easy to do well on. The class was a lot of fun though.  Beppe is a fun professor, and made 8am a little less horrible. The class is small, so you bond over the horror that is pre-dawn class.
@
Giuseppe Cavatorta
/course/1274
Italian is hard, and the Rassias method is hard too...the classes are fast-paced and most of the time you really don't know what's going on. Beppe speaks in italian the whole time, but by the end of the term, you def understand 90% of what he's saying. He really tried hard to get to know each and everyone of us, and he's very cool and down to earth, even if you weren't the brightest student in the class. you get used to the italian and get comfortable sounding like an idiot, but you definitely learn it. the drill and italian table are definitely time-consuming but they definitely help, and you get to use and practice the italian you learn. the classes are small so you get to make great friends and get to know a great professor who's actually interested in getting to know you! take this course!
@

Beppe is incredible. Over the course of the term, he becomes your friend, not just your professor. He is an incredibly dedicated teacher who wants you to learn Italian and have a fun time doing it.  I have taken Spanish and French here at Dartmouth, so the class was easy for me but I still feel like I learned tons. As with any language class at Dartmouth, of course, it's pretty work-intensive if you haven't had experience with that kind of class before (ie, a Romance language). But if you want to learn Italian, take it from Beppe!
@

decent amount of work and time, but the professor did a really good job pacing things and making himself available
@
Giuseppe Cavatorta
/course/1274
This is a good class that effectively teaches the basics of the language.  Getting up early is hard, but is a must if you want to do well.  It also promotes a strong sense of camaraderie with your fellow students because you suffer together in being tired and you tend to learn arbitrary facts about their lives in order to facilitate the learning of the language.  Beginning level language courses are always trying on the sleep schedule, but it this is an extremely effective way to learn it and you leave you first term feeling capable to speak at least a little Italian.

This course was phenomenal!!! I cannot reccomend Prf. Cavatorta (Beppe) enough.  He was always enthusiastic in class, and inspired an interest and love of italian language and culture.  This is one of the most fun and fast-paced courses I have taken at Dartmouth.  I can't believe how much I learned in just one term.  This was a great class. If you're taking italian, take it with Beppe!

Beppe is absolutely incredible. Every day with him was so much fun because he's super charismatic and really makes you want to learn italian. We got to play a lot of games and do partner/group exerices to practice speaking. Also, Beppe brings in italian tortas (cakes) for people's birthdays- talk about dedication! He is hands down one of the sweetest, most lovable profs you will ever have.
@
Giuseppe Cavatorta
/course/1274
I would take another course with Beppe without hesitation.  He is a great professor, very enthusiastic, always around campus holding Italian Club events or inviting his students over for dinner.  However, between drill, exams, work books, lab books, Italian tavola and semi-mandatory attendance at Italian Club events, it felt like I was taking 3 classes combined into one.  If you are looking for an easy way to satisfy your language requirements, this is not it, but if you have a genuine interest in Italian I would definitely take this course, especially if Beppe is teaching it.

This class was so great!  Prof Cavatorta (Bepper) was amazing!  I didn't really expect to have too tough of a time, having studied Spanish for five years, but it was even easier than I expected!  I learned more Italian in 10 weeks than I did by my 3rd year of Spanish!  Even if you have never studied a language before, it is not hard to learn.  Beppe is amazing; from Day One, all that is spoken in class is Italian, and you pick it up quickly.  There was little outside work, because of Drill.  Morning Drill sucked, but it works nonetheless.  Take this class, you won't be disappointed!

Brigitte Mosenthal
/course/1274
Mosenthal is an amazing professor. She is fun and funny, and the class is extremely enjoyable. That said, if you do not complete your homework, she will notice and call you out on it. She expects completion and participation, but is totally fine with students getting things wrong—messing up is part of learning a language. The most important thing in this class is to just let loose and have fun with it. 10/10 would recommend taking French 1 with Mosenthal.
@
Brigitte Mosenthal
/course/1274
Mosenthal is a great teacher. If you pay attention and do your work, it's not hard to get a good grade. I went from not knowing French at all to being able to hold a conversation, which is pretty cool.
@
Brigitte Mosenthal
/course/1274
It's what you would expect for French 1. Very straightforward and Brigitte does a good job of explaining the material for those who have never had french before.  The quizzes were sometimes tricky but not hard to do well on.  I didn't like doing the weekly skits and found them relatively pointless in helping me learn the language but I don't think they really influence the grade that much.  Not much out of class work except for the drill workbooks which take a bit of time.
@
Brigitte Mosenthal
/course/1274
If you're good at retaining information and are pretty good with formulas/languages definitely take the class. Professor Mosenthal is great and makes the class go by quickly.  The only thing though is that the class goes pretty quickly, and the quizzes are pretty loaded. She pretty much sticks to grammar, so if you're good at formulas (which is how French is done) then you'll do well. You just have to pay attention, because she loads all the quizzes with irregulars/exceptions that are meant to trip you up.   Good class though.
@
Brigitte Mosenthal
/course/1274
Quizzes They are covered in class; pay especial attention to any exceptions or other "mini" rules on grammar since these will definitely appear on the quizzes and trip you up (read the book if you have to). Use formulas to memorize grammar and do not forget to apply all possible rules (your quiz grade will suffer significantly if you so much as forget an es or sse for plural, feminine...).   SKITS ARE EVERY WEEK EXCEPT 1ST AND LAST; PLEASE be creative with the material so that you all won't be bored on Friday. ACT and MEMORIZE your lines well, so you can follow each other and so that your skit grade is better for it  Professor do not be afraid to talk or ask questions even if you've never taken French. Just remember that you have to speak French in class. Clear, helpful, has a sense of humor.   Drill tough luck for winter mornings; read the next chapter's scenarios... since the drill will cover it verbatim. Makes it less painful for everyone when drill moves faster.

This was a really great language class.  It was fairly easy, but Professor Mosenthal still got a lot out of her class.  The quizzes covered a lot of ground but were very straightforward and fair.  She was very understanding and sympathetic to me and everyone else I saw who missed classes for any legitimate reason.  She is always genuinely glad to answer any questions you have and she really seems to heartily care for all her students.  Drill was also really excellent, although I have a feeling this might be completely dependent on drill instructors.  Ricky Cole is so energetic and helpful that it is worth it to take his drill section no matter what if you have the opportunity.  He really forced us to speak French all the time, tried to keep drill interesting, and even taught us quite a bit that we never learned in class.  Don't worry about drill, it sucks to get up in the morning but ultimately you get way more out of your day anyway than sleeping in to 10 or 11.  Bottom line is as I progress through French if Mosenthal pops up on a class I am interested in I will try to take her section.
@
Brigitte Mosenthal
/course/1274
This class was pretty much fun and although you don't need to put too much work into it, you will probably get out with some basic knowledge. Professor Mosenthal is very sweet and energetic and really wants people to do well in the class. She is also very enthusiastic about having weekly skits, which are fun in the beginning, but get a bit tiring by the end of the term. The weekly quizzes are also pretty straightforward; the only inconvenience might be the fact that the people in the class had different backgrounds in French, anywhere from 'never seen it before' to 'French speaker', so that might be a little bit intimidating in the beginning.  Overall, I think it's an easy, good class to take.

@
Regine Tessier
/course/1274
Professor Tessier is a very endearing older French woman, like a French grandma.  She is not, however, a professor.  She had no clear lesson plan in class and did not reinforce culture, repetition, practice, or any aspect of language study at Dartmouth.  The only advantage to having her as a professor, besides her bizarre and sometimes hilarious quirks, is her ability to help with pronounciation as a native speaker.  Fortunately she is a very easy grader.
@
Regine Tessier
/course/1274
But that was really about it. She was old and adorable, but she wasn't a great teacher. She was sweet and had a great accent, but she was disorganized and would digress a lot. She would answer questions if you had them, but overall she didn't teach anything that we couldn't have learned from reading the textbook. She did make us speak in French during class though and corrected our pronunciation.
@
Regine Tessier
/course/1274
Even as I write this review and think about French I with Tessier, I start smiling.  Tessier is a charming older woman who reminds me of a (French) grandmother, and she generally cares about everyone's progress.  She does, however, have her favorites, and these people ALWAYS get A's on the quizzes, regardless of how they perform.  But even if you haven't had French before (as was my situation), the class (with Tessier) is easy--just read the book and do well on the first quiz (so you become one of her favorites).  And NEVER be late to class skipping class if preferable to arriving two minutes late.  Overall, though, it's a great class.  You will learn French, and you will learn to love Miss Regine Tessier.
@
Regine Tessier
/course/1274
Tessier was all over the place with her lectures, and would teach whatever she felt like teaching that day. We didn't have a syllabus, and she rarely followed the order of the textbook. Despite this, she explained things pretty well when she did teach them, but you ended up teaching yourself a lot of the material in each chapter. The material wasn't very difficult though; I had never taken French before, so it might be too easy for anyone who had. Tessier's grading also had no real system and she seemed to just give grades on quizzes somewhat randomly. Attendance and being on time to her class is very important.

Tessier wasn't bad, but she is fairly disorganized, and the quizzes didn't always cover all of the material, or the same material, that we had just been studying.  You'll still learn if you simply study, though.  French I isn't very hard.
@
Regine Tessier
/course/1274
Tessier was a dear sweet lady and I thought she would have been great teaching French 9 or 10. But she expected the French One-ies to be much better in French than we were and she would get irritated when people messed things up that I thought could have easily been messed up.   In addition, she tended to get scatterbrained and forget what she was teaching and would often linger on an irrelevant subject when we had more pressing things to go over. Also, she routinely taught us things that we didn't need to know (like the future tense in week 4) and skipped things we did need to know

Professoressa Essex was the best. She taught her class to suit everyone's weaknesses/needs. She was considerate, funny, and ALWAYS willing to help. The first day of class, she spoke in ALL ITALIAN, that was daunting for a freshman, and then I got a C on the first dettato, but she somehow convinced me to remain in the class, and I do not regret. When I took italian back freshman winter, we had instead of the allotted 9 weeks, 8 weeks and one two days(snow day), so we had to learn 10 chapters (preliminary to chpr 9) in that short amount of time. But somehow we all managed to fill 2 pages when writing an italian. It is DEF an intense course, stay on top of things otherwise you will be screwed if you fall behind. It is essentially a fun class, not challenging at all if you don't procrastinate. However, languages are my weakness so I'm expecting a B+. I think I would have done better if I didn't concentrate as much on Chem.I wish it were an A, but I'm not pushing my luck. I am definitely considering to minor in Italian. It is such a beautiful language. I recommend taking Italian 1 with Professoressa Essex. Ciao!   BTW morning drills SUCK--A LOT--you'd think that after doing it everyday for the first few weeks you'd get used to it...well you don't--in fact, it got more difficult to wake up as the term progressed--luck with that

this class was pretty simple.  the material was not confusing or hard, it just took time to memorize vocab and learn the irregular grammar.  however, prof canepa requires that you attend all of the classes and deducts from your grade if you miss, even for valid reasons.  also, while the work is not hard, it usually needs to be done each day since canepa assigns assignments other than the syllabus that need to be handed in the next day.  overall, this class taught beginner italian well and there were some good lectures

Italian 1 is incredibly basic. If you've even studied a word of Italian prior to signing up, you are set. Even if you haven't, it is possible for anybody to succeed in this course. Canepa is pretty dynamic, even though sometimes the activies we had to do were not welcomed at 9 AM. The homework was really simple, but the workbook and lab manual that we were required to do wasnt much more than busy work.  This class meets every day, and there is drill everyday. If you're not committed to going to class and drill, dont bother taking this course, because you will be lost after the first week. But if you are looking for an engaging introduction to the Italian language, this is the class for you.

So rushed!  Though I guess that's how all languages are taught here... it just seemed like class time was not used as effectively as it could have been.  We didn't really get to speak in class that much... This may have been because the class was fairly large for an introductory language class--about 20 people--and morning drill was awful.    Prof. Poivre is very nice, however, and full of spunk and fun creative ways of getting us involved--we did weekly skits, which really were fun and helped us learn.  She also baked for us several times... I'm not gonna lie, those french can cook!

French 1 is a fast-paced language course.  However, if you do all the homework, drills, and language lab stuff, you will do fine.  The weekly quizzes are realtively easy, but the final exam is pretty long (two hours) and covers everything learned in the term. But, overall, it's an effective course, instilling an astonishing amount of language knowledge in just ten weeks.

If you enjoy a fast-paced, grammar based language class and prefer to learn the material on your own from the book, then this class might work for you, other wise though, don't count on it.  It's unfortunate that the French department assigns profs who have never taught before to the basic language course.  A good professor with experience might make this class a little more bearable.  As it was, attending lectures was just a repeat of whatever was in the book, and the professor was not understanding of those who didn't pick things up the first time around.   Expect to do your learning in drill and on your own, and expect to penalized for what you don't know, but now rewarded for what you do...

Even though we have to take languages, this class was very enjoyable and the teacher was laid back.....essentially a perfect class except for drill and all the class time, but you get that with any language...good times were had by all

I have taken over 3 years of french before and this class was difficult even for me.  First, the prof does not know english.  This created problems throughout the entire course. Second, she handed out way too many extra handouts during class and then tested over very little material.  Overall, I did well in the class but I had to rely completely on my prior french knowledge because she didn't know how to teach. Outside of the class she is a very nice person and means well. I personally blaim the department for having a non-english speaking person attempt to teach introductory french.

I would reccomend taking this course from a native french-speaker.  While it is difficult at first to understand this professor, once she teaches you how to listen and understand french by teaching the course in that language.

Julia Viazmenski

For a begining language class the pace and structure of this course was just right.  Viazmenski goes out of her way to form a personal relationship with each student in the class, and is always avaliable via blitz or during her office hours.  Julia is mother to a two year old daughter, and is very in touch with how to teach beginning language.  She was never abrasive in class, from day one had us refer to her by her first name, and was always sympathetic to illness or other problems that people had throughout the term.  Our class had a dinnertime tavola at the end of the term where we cooked and got together to speak italian, and it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience.  I didn't have to take the course, but chose to, and was thus very pleased with the results.  The environment created within the class room is conducive to an introductory class as Julia gets everyone to let down their academic fronts and really experience with the language, knowing that if you make a mistake that she will correct you.  A good mix of visual, auditory and oral exercizes optimized class time, and drill only compounded the experience.  If you need to fulfill your language requirement or if you are just looking for an easy, fun and worthwhile class, then Italian 1 with Julia is the way to go!

The class was A LOT of work, and I am a science major, so I am used to labs, but this class required so much time! It is necessary though to learn all of the material and be comfortable with it. The prof was really nice and very available online.

If you haven't been introduced to the Italian Department, they are amazing.  Professors like Marco are very welcoming and friendly and genuinely want to get to know you and help you to learn.

So Marco is the coolest. He tries to make class fun, and is pretty entertaining with his jokes and sucky drawings. The class is paced quickly but I think that's the case with all beginner language courses at Dartmouth. If you're interested in learning Italian, definitely go for Marco.

Professor Stoppino makes this class. She makes getting up for a nine ever morning totally worth while because her attitude guarantees that the first thing you'll do every day is laugh and smile. Granted, she won't teach you all you need to know and you need to study the book to understand the language and do well on tests, but her class is so much fun that I would have gone even if I wasn't learning a thing. If you have the time and the interest, do yourself a favor and take this class. If you like to smile, you'll love Stoppino.

If Roberto Benigni was a woman, he would be Nora Stoppino.  I had a 9, and every day she'd come in - eyes wide open, violent and excited hand gestures - ready to wake up the class and start teaching italian.  Although she is intelligent and competent in Italian (I'd hope so since shes from Milan)as well as funny (in her Jerry Louis/weird European manner) and enthusiastic, she is not a great italian teacher.  Her lessons have little substance; she tries to integrate class-pleasing humor with the material, but incorporates too much humor and not enough lucid explanations.  You appreciate the humor and that all the material is covered, but there is a point at which you realize the concepts would be easier to grasp if she would use more technical language; i dont think she has faith in her class to grasp the meanings the italian words for parts of speach or sentence structure. The italian department has done a mediocre job of setting up the class, too.  The textbook is frustrating because vocabulary is sometimes only introduced in the review section of the chapters, as opposed to within the chapter itself.  The homework is extremely dull, but it does help you learn the material. There are bright notes.  The class is easy- the exams arent excruciatingly difficult in the first place, and are graded leniently.  My drill instructor was amazing, and of course the Italian LSA's are incomparable.

Great class and a great Prof. McConnell is extremely understanding and accommodating, but still rigorous enough to make the class a really productive one. I definitely learned a lot even though it was a very low-stress environment. The only downside is how time consuming the class is (you use all X hours, plus you have to do Drill 4x a week). However, Drill and the continuous homework make it so that you just have to "review" for quizzes instead of actually studying. She's also really organized with assignments and due dates, and makes everything very straightforward. Overall, would definitely recommend taking French 1 with her!
@

She is super sweet and understanding with any problem you might have. Some people say its something to do with the fact that she went to Dartmouth - whatever it is, I love her. Workload is normal, manageable. You submit homework every Friday for the week and do some online exercises. Some people find it harder than others depending on your background in Romance languages or just French specifically.

Sweetest professor ever, very understanding if you're having trouble. Day to day workload pretty minimal, hw for that week is due the day of the quiz/exam. Lots of in-class activity and participation but not a lot of pressure since it's interactive activities that everyone has to do. Cares a lot about her students, & will write you a great recommendation if you want to go on an LSA or FSP! Note as with most language classes, everything is in French from day 1 which is great but a little overwhelming. Also, uses every x-hour and you have to go to drill 4x/week. Still would recommend very highly.

She was down right bitter and untrusting. Treated all the students like elementary school children. She required almost 100% class attendance with the threat of lowering a student's grade by one letter per absence when all she ever did was repeat the book word-for-word during "lectures". Her grading is extremely vague as up to 20% is decided by "effort-progress", which is whatever she decides based on her impression of you. She intrudes on students' privacy by asking them things like "what kind of illness did you have that made you miss class" or "do you have a drinking problem", which is completely out-of-line with the Dartmouth Honor Principle, because we're all here based upon a system of trust and honor, not cynicism and mistrust. Instead of doing skits every week like all normal foreign language courses, we stood around in a cirlce like a herd of sheep looking at her magazines that were at least 20 years old.  The worst part is she always fakes a smile or laughs nervously to appear kind and smooth, but all the students know her real character enough not to like her at all.  She totally washed away my interest in French. I didn't need to take it for the requirement, but was doing it purely out of interest for the language. That interest is now completely gone thanks to her.

Catherine Prat is from France, so she is very passionate about teaching her language and culture. A beautiful person outside of class, I spent many hours in her office hours trying to speak french; she was very helpful. French 1 is a bore---tons of grammar, tons of work, all the time...having class with Catherine Prat made this all the more easy. She is really easy to get along with, and is on the whole a very funny person. If you have to take french, and if she's still around (she's going back to France in over a year), then take her class!!!

Fodor is engaging during class but can seem kind of aloof when you talk to him one-on-one. There is little work outside of class and drill. Regular attendance helps you with the readings, weekly exercises, and weekly skits, which are the best part of the class. Obviously having a background in Spanish or Italian helps a lot, both with vocabulary and grammar.

Giacomo was entertaining enough to get me to pay attention at 900am every day of the week-- which, believe me, is saying a lot. Since he won't be teaching at Dartmouth next year, my only advice is to take this class with a young, energetic, native Italian if at all possible.

Course Just an average French 1 class. Nothing too interesting. Sort of hard the first few weeks when you don't understand anything and drill can suck but its a good class. Learned a lot.  Professor A really funny prof. He loves having students visit him in his office because he is bored and just likes to talk. He is basically just a character from Ratatouille that came to teach French at Dartmouth. Murphy is also a lax grader but doesn't usually teach French 1.   Workload Just normal work. I know this prof gave less work than the others so it was easier but also it was harder going into French 2 with a weak writing base.

Yasmine Renault

This was an excellent introduction to the french language.  I had taken four (rather useless) years of french at my high school, and so i decided to learn french from the very beginning. I am not sorry I did.  Mme. Renault is a superb French teacher, and she is clearly enthusiastic about what she is teaching. Every day, Mme. Renault hands out her self-made worksheets which summarize the concepts covered during that day.  These are nearly always of more use than the book. If you want to take french 1, do everything you can to have it with Mme. Renault.

Julie, or Joo-lie as we fondly called her, bonded very well with the class and was an effective teacher.

Take French 1 with Julie while she's here!

Rota is clinically insane. His lectures are all over the place and manages to squeeze material in at the last minute. I don't really know what we did in class and I don't really know how I learned italian, but somehow I picked a bit up. But Rota is crazy in a good, fun way, I went to class less for the material and more to see what crazy antics he'd be up to. The tests and quizzes are rather straightforward and easy as long as you know what's going on.

Bottom line fun and appreciation of the language overides academic discipline in this class
