Prof. Fabricant gave us a ton of work on a daily basis...much of it had to be typed and handed in which was a problem for me because i was too busy to do a lot of it...but overall the tests were pretty fair.   she was tough grader...weekly quizes, a midterm and a final...but at the end of the term i think she was fair with the final course grades...but it will definetly the course of your term you have to focus on if you havent taken any french before

Fieke was just brutal.  Her strictness and teaching style made me feel pretty stupid almost dayly.  If you want to take french 1... do not take it with her.

I was just interested in getting a good background in French (that I plan to continue to develop in French II), and this class certainly helped me achieve that. It's true waking up every morning for drill is a drag at times, but if anything it forces you to have a long day (this is good) and, well, to have three meals (I recommend egg sandwiches at Collis). Fieke (is it "Fake"? Nobody knows) is admittedly very fast-paced, but always halts when there are questions. The course, in all, does what it sets out to do. So if you want or have to take French, you could do worse than this.

the class definitely helped me learn the basics of the language, but the professor was horrible for a college-level class.  i felt like i was in middle school a lot of the time and it was really uninspiring.  but i guess i learned french decently well, so you can't knock that... unless you hate french, in which case i'm surprised you've read so far into my review.  but while i have your attention, let me tell you about myself.  i'm a sensitive guy with an edgy side to me.  i like getting my adrenaline pumping both inside and outside the classroom.  when i'm not busy failing french 1, i like to keep myself occupied by sinking saves, listening to musical styling's of cam fortin, and straight up playing women.  i can't even remember the last time i DIDN'T score with a girl.  and i have french 1 to thank for that!

THis class was required for me. I knew that learning another language was going to be hard but it didn't require the amount of suffering I endured. Prof. Fabricant was happy with nothing less than an A on all tests and quizzes. She gave us tons of work everyday and expected you to have it done for the next class. The only thing that saved me was getting a tutor and my drill instructor. If it wasn't for them I would not have passed French. French is an awesome language to learn but try to avoid Prof. Fabricant.

I love languages and feel that I am pretty good at them, however, this course tries to cram way too much material into one term.  Even if you study every night and memorize like a fiend, it is impossible to force your mind to absorb everything that is expected of you.  Worst of all, you cannot build on your knowledge until what preceeds the new concept is adequately learned, which is something you cannot control given the pace of this class.  Professor Fabricant, although she seems anxious to have you understand in her office hours, does not pay attention to students' questions in class and instead deems "getting through all the material" more important than rectifying doubts, which is very frustrating as a student.  Also, she gives a large amount of homework and is always trying to sniff out the person who perhaps couldn't get that particular assignment done in one night, since that's all the notice you have.  In fairness, I sincerely believe she is invested in the class and cares how her class performs, which is why as her student you feel an enormous amount of pressure.

The language classes move very quickly at Dartmouth, and French 1 is no exception.  At times, the class was frustrating and the material difficult to keep up with, but in the end when you can keep a conversation with your professor in French, the course is very self-gratifying.

the course is alright...but if french isn't going to be your major, avoid Fabricant.  she really isn't that bad of a person...she is just really into french.  So basically she assigns way, way, way, way too much work...and it's all pointless busy work that doesn't help enough for the time you have to spend doing it.  i do have to admit that i did learn the material well...but i could have done the same on my own without all of here extra busy work.

She's a little tougher than other French profs but if you take good notes you'll be really well prepared for the tests every week. The weekly tests really help you understand the material and Fabricant is also very helpful and will help you if you aren't doing well. The final is very very easy and short. You'll definitely learn the material if you take this class. Fabricant is great!!!

Seriously, way too much work. Gave us tons of hw even though it was an everyday class. it was insane.

She is super sweet and understanding with any problem you might have. Some people say its something to do with the fact that she went to Dartmouth - whatever it is, I love her. Workload is normal, manageable. You submit homework every Friday for the week and do some online exercises. Some people find it harder than others depending on your background in Romance languages or just French specifically.

Sweetest professor ever, very understanding if you're having trouble. Day to day workload pretty minimal, hw for that week is due the day of the quiz/exam. Lots of in-class activity and participation but not a lot of pressure since it's interactive activities that everyone has to do. Cares a lot about her students, & will write you a great recommendation if you want to go on an LSA or FSP! Note as with most language classes, everything is in French from day 1 which is great but a little overwhelming. Also, uses every x-hour and you have to go to drill 4x/week. Still would recommend very highly.

She was down right bitter and untrusting. Treated all the students like elementary school children. She required almost 100% class attendance with the threat of lowering a student's grade by one letter per absence when all she ever did was repeat the book word-for-word during "lectures". Her grading is extremely vague as up to 20% is decided by "effort-progress", which is whatever she decides based on her impression of you. She intrudes on students' privacy by asking them things like "what kind of illness did you have that made you miss class" or "do you have a drinking problem", which is completely out-of-line with the Dartmouth Honor Principle, because we're all here based upon a system of trust and honor, not cynicism and mistrust. Instead of doing skits every week like all normal foreign language courses, we stood around in a cirlce like a herd of sheep looking at her magazines that were at least 20 years old.  The worst part is she always fakes a smile or laughs nervously to appear kind and smooth, but all the students know her real character enough not to like her at all.  She totally washed away my interest in French. I didn't need to take it for the requirement, but was doing it purely out of interest for the language. That interest is now completely gone thanks to her.

This class was okay - drill was kind of a drag, but the drill instructor was great so it helped a little. Swain is a stickler for being on time and for attendence, but she's a good prof.

Highly recommended course for those interested in beginner's French.  Prof. Prat truly cares about the subject and shows genuine concern in her students' progress.  Definitely a worthwhile experience.

Catherine Prat is from France, so she is very passionate about teaching her language and culture. A beautiful person outside of class, I spent many hours in her office hours trying to speak french; she was very helpful. French 1 is a bore---tons of grammar, tons of work, all the time...having class with Catherine Prat made this all the more easy. She is really easy to get along with, and is on the whole a very funny person. If you have to take french, and if she's still around (she's going back to France in over a year), then take her class!!!

Fodor is engaging during class but can seem kind of aloof when you talk to him one-on-one. There is little work outside of class and drill. Regular attendance helps you with the readings, weekly exercises, and weekly skits, which are the best part of the class. Obviously having a background in Spanish or Italian helps a lot, both with vocabulary and grammar.

Giacomo was entertaining enough to get me to pay attention at 900am every day of the week-- which, believe me, is saying a lot. Since he won't be teaching at Dartmouth next year, my only advice is to take this class with a young, energetic, native Italian if at all possible.

I thoroughly enjoyed Giacomo's class. His energy was phenomenal and greatly appreciated, especially considering class was held so early each morning.
