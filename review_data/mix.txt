Huge workload and extremely hard. I think you really need to have a background in CS or some natural god given ability to thrive in this class Do not take this course with other hard classes. Cormen has tough grading rubric as well. Overall, super rewarding and interesting course, but do not expect an easy time.

He's a good professor but it's a 190 student class, and there's virtually no interaction between the prof and the students except for the questions. The class period tends to get very boring very fast. It's a nice if you're trying to experience new fields in your freshman year, but I would not recommend taking it for a distributive. The workload is heavy. I agree that you should have a natural talent or CS background to achieve high grades in this course.

Hard AF! Prof Cormen is good but very demanding class especially if you have not taken any CS before. Do not take with 2 other tough classes - many withdrew.

Came into CS1 with absolutely no prior experience. If you are interested in CS and find logical/problem-solving puzzles as satisfying as I do, you will be able to do well if you just put in a few hours of extra studying a week (usually just 1-2 for me). Sometimes I felt pretty behind compared to other students with lots of prior experience (especially after the first midterm), but I can definitely say that if you read the lectures Cormen posts on the website, go to section more often then not, and are reasonably intellectually competent, you can easily pull out a B+/A- in this class.

Half of the class had prior coding experience. During first midterm half of the room completed it within an hour, while another half was there for 3 hours. I'm afraid in order to get something close to B- you have to learn Python on your own PRIOR to enrolling into this course. I expected it to be intro course, but ended up dropping it after week 3. First 2 weeks were intro and very deceiving. Grading system is strange. Your lab assignments and homework can change your grade only to plus or minus while grade by itself is based on the 3 exams. To get A you need 98% on exams and above 90% on labs I believe. Prof Cormen is funny guy, but tough. Unless you want to major in CS or have Python knowledge AVOID.

Doing the problems is essential!

The course is easier if you have a strong chem backgroud, of course.

The class was not that bad. I particularly enjoy chemistry, but if you're not a science major or you don't need to take this class, then i dont recommend it.

Chem 5 is tough... don't take it to fulfill a lab req. It's necessary for chem majors and pre-med tho, so if u have to take it stay on top of the problem sets. It's definately a weeder class but prof. kull did a great job trying to make it interesting. lectures were good, but do the reading first otherwise it's a bit hard to follow.

he lectures straight from the book, some people don't even bother going to class, but it's good to hear it coming from the prof.  if you do the optional hw, read the book, and study, you might learn something.

This class is tough but manageable. Its reputation is much worse than the actual class. Labs can actually be fun, but there is a lot of busy work associated with labs---prelabs, data sheets, etc. There is a lot of stuff to do for this class class 3x a week, lab, Xhours, TA hours, problem sets, lab stuff, etc. The exams are really tough, but they are curved fairly. Professor Kull is really nice and always available when you need him. The nice thing about prof Kull is that he is always trying to help you do better...he is just a really nice guy. TAs are also awesome!! Milde, the lab instructor, is nice as well.

This class would make a good fourth class. Its not too diffcutl but it does require a small amount of effort. U need to be able to have your readings done for the friday discussion groups and class attendance does count toward your grade. So you need to be committed to coming to class so you can sign in. But lots of people came and just slept through the class. It was whatever. The final was very simple. 40 multiple choice that took all of twenty mins.  The take home part was due weeks before so as a fourth class you would only need to study just a bit for the final. And the bonus is the readings aren't half bad.

despite what prof. tishler says on the first day of class, this IS a gut class, and NOBODY takes this class seriously.  with good reason, too. i mean, come on -- this is dartmouth...we should NOT be having classes on "vampires, witches, and firebirds."  what the hell is a "firebird" anyway???  this class is a JOKE. take this class if you need to boost your GPA (like me), but otehrwise, this class is completely useless.  this is the easiest class i've taken since middle school.  i completely owned this class for the first half of the term -- and then i got cocky, and stopped doing any work at all, and my grade ended up slipping to a B+.  but if you're not a complete bum like i am, there is no reason why you should not get an A in this class. to get an A in this class, you need to do the following go to class (for some ass reason, she decided to start taking attendance in a lecture class just to make people actually start going -- didnt work for me), go to discussion groups (you dont need to be awake during discussion, just be there), do the readings (this is not nearly as tough as it seems -- remember when you were 7 and your mom made you read hansel and gretel, snow white, and all that other crap??  yeah, same thing...just to out, get trashed, and come home and read some fairy tales...quite pleasants, actually), and review the slides before the exams.  you do not need to put in any extra effort other than that. half the people fall asleep during lectures, so dont be one of those suckers who frantically scribbles down notes.  just go to lecture, sign in the attendance sheet, and get the hell out of there before she sees you.  remember, this IS A GUT CLASS -- even though prof. tishler is trying ot make it a real class -- it IS STILL A GUT CLASS.  have fun with it!  peace!

I took this class because i needed the distrib and i thought it sounded pretty interesting. When i heard that it was supposed to be really easy, that was just icing on the cake. Its amazing, however, how a co-taught class can be ruined by one terrible professor. Tishler's lectures were more boring than anything ive ever done, including staring blankly at a wall. She simply read off a piece of paper like it was a speech, and if she lost her place she would get rattled and take about 30 seconds to regain composure. She made the emphasis of the course memorizing random facts from the readings instead of understanding the material. Also, she doesnt understand how to grade papers. I'm not saying all this because of a bad grade; i did fine in the class. It was just boring, full of obscure facts, and taught by a terrible prof.

I'll be honest, I took this class because it was one of the more well-known "guts" at Dartmouth.  Apparently the profs had also become aware of their course's notoreity/fame, and made the course a lot tougher when I took it.   The tests are very nitpicky, and the grading on essays was harsher than I've seen in any other lit class.  The discussion part of the class, which wasn't useful to say the least, was supposed to bolster our grades, but they were also graded with surprising harshness. The material's not that engaging, unless you're really into fairytales.  I felt kind of silly, trying to cram minutae from a bunch of fairy tales before the exams.   My search for the easy third class continues...

The grading was extremely unfair and was frequently completely arbitrary.  I have never posted a review before, but this class was so terrible it warrants one.  Do not expect any help or cultivation of learning.

attendence sign up sheets and inane discussion sections wrecked this gut that has fun material, but mediocre lectures.  For a class that one might need as a break from major classes or lab classes this class was too stringent. As an actually complex class that draws you in and makes you want to do well, it totally failed.

interesting course, more reading than i was expecting, discussions were helpful
